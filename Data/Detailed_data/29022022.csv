In 2015/16 the organisation led a 12-month process to develop a Lancashire-wide partnership to provide specialist employability and skills support to unemployed people aged 50 and over. This project is known as Age of Opportunity and is part of the Building Better Opportunities programme. 

Building Better Opportunities (BBO) is a national programme funded by The National Lottery Community Fund (NLCF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) to invest in local projects tackling the root causes of poverty, promoting social inclusion and driving local jobs and growth.

The Age of Opportunity project consists of approximately 13 diverse delivery partners from the voluntary, community, and social enterprise sectors, coming together to deliver specialist support for key groups across Lancashire. Selnet is the lead partner and does not undertake any delivery or direct support to participants. Age of Opportunity has been operational since August 2016 and has recently received additional investment extending project delivery to the end of 2022.

Over the lifetime of the project, over 2300 disadvantaged people will benefit from support tailored to their individual needs and interests to overcome complex barriers and move towards work and training. This project aims to engage with older people who live in the Lancashire LEP area and have low or no skills, thereby preventing them from engaging with training and employment opportunities. It will support them in moving towards and into employment, training and education.

Selnet is looking to select 2 suitably qualified and experienced organisations to provide employability skills support to Age of Opportunity participants from within Lancashire.  Preferred bidder status will be awarded to the 2 organisations offering the most economically advantageous tenders. Proposals are sought from organisations that can demonstrate competence in engaging with and delivering relevant support to people aged 50 and over with multiple and complex barriers into employment, training or education.

Approved bids put forward by the successful associates will form the framework from which this delivery activity will take place.

This programme has been developed to help Greater Manchester come back stronger from the challenges presented before, during and after the pandemic; better equipped and better prepared with the skills needed for the future. Greater Manchester has been chosen to run this programme as test and learn, which could later be rolled out throughout the UK. It was commissioned by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) with funding from the European Social Fund (ESF).

The Skills for Growth-SME Support Programme is a fully funded, tailored service to help up-skill businesses and their employees and improve business productivity. The programme will help business leaders grow their business through re-shaping, developing their talent and enhancing their team's performance. It is offering impartial advice and guidance through one-to-one consultations either with our skills coaches, wellbeing champions and apprenticeship specialists or our procured associates.

GMBS would like to procure providers, consultants and associates with established relationships with SMEs in Greater Manchester, to assist in the delivery of the Skills for Growth-SME Support Programme. Procured associates will refer eligible businesses that could benefit from this programme of support. Once a business is approved, the associate undertakes a collaborative consultation with them to create a Skills Productivity Plan (SPP) that identifies the needs of the business and between 3 to 10 Individual Skills Plans (ISDP) with employees, to assess the skills needed by them to improve their productivity and growth. A minimum of 1 SSP and 3 ISDPs will be required. All plans must be completed within 3 weeks of an organisation joining the programme and must meet quality and compliance expectations. Once plans are approved, they will be passed to a Growth Company Skills Coach, who will continue to work with these organisations and provide the ongoing support. 

GMBS will pay the consultant, provider or associate a maximum cost of £450.00 + VAT for the identification of a business, the signed SPP and a minimum of 3 signed ISDPs.  
Each additional ISDP completed with a business (to a maximum of 10) will be paid at a maximum of £50,00 + VAT per ISDP.
Payment will be made upon receipt of the signed SPP/ISDPs and upon confirmation they have passed quality and compliance checks.",,,"North West","79400000 ","Nick Batty",nick.batty@growthco.uk,"Lee House","90 Great Bridgewater St",Manchester,"M1 5JW",England,"0161 237 4044",https://www.businessgrowthhub.com/tenders,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/manchestergrowthcompany/aspx/Home ",,01/03/2022,30/04/2022,28/02/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,10000000,,28/02/2022,0,"[NO AWARD|No Award|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,01/03/2022,30/04/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,13:00

Its Fire Risk Management Strategy sets out how this will be delivered and includes Article 9 of the Order: Risk assessment.

The authority has approximately 500 buildings to which the Order applies, of these 400 are non-residential settings with 700 communal areas (known as assessable areas) requiring a fire risk assessment. A 'site visit' is required for a block with potentially more than one assessable area under the same roof and deemed to be one premises for the purposes of the fire risk inspection program.

The 'sites' have been arranged into geographical areas in Cambridge City.
The premises for assessment are varied in their design but tend to be older stock (post war 1950's onwards) and are mostly low rise; small ground + first floor blocks, many with multiple communal areas. There are some blocks with 4 floors and a balcony approach which are comprised of maisonettes above 4.5m. Many flats are leasehold properties. There are no high rise/risk blocks to assess.

In 2020, Cambridge City Council halted its fire risk assessment program due to the Covid-19 pandemic and also brought its fire risk assessments in-house having previously been contracted out.

The effect of this has been that the fire risk assessment program has fallen significantly behind with over 300 blocks requiring new initial fire risk assessments.

Cambridge City Council is seeking to bring the fire risk assessment program back on track by the end of September 2022.",,,England,"71317000 ","Amy Kenny",Amy.Kenny@cambridge.gov.uk,"Cambridge City Council",Guildhall,Cambridge,"CB2 3QJ","United Kingdom","'+44 7718664779",,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=175fb3b6-a461-ec11-8110-005056b64545 ",,04/04/2022,30/09/2022,31/01/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,40000,40000,25/02/2022,45000,"[TEAM Safety services|Unit 4, Jarman House

Kent County Council (KCC) is seeking a Provider to continue the delivery of the 
successful Kent Sheds programme. 
The Sheds programme started in Australia in response to studies about men's informal 
learning preferences in community contexts, and some men's aversion to some 
traditional forms of adult and community education. Sheds organisations are typically 
located in shed or workshop-type spaces in community settings and provide opportunities 
for regular hands-on activity by groups deliberately and mainly comprising of men. The
Shed concept has now spread across the UK, and there is a thriving Shed community in 
existence across Kent. More information can be found at http://mensSheds.org.uk/ which 
is the website representing the national movement across the UK. 
Sheds offer a place for people to pursue practical interests in a social environment 
offering the opportunity to learn new skills, to share their skills with others and to 
socialise. Many factors attract men to community-based Sheds including friendship, the 
lack of compulsion, opportunities for mentoring and sociability. There is real value in 
Sheds tackling isolation - men consistently report a strong sense of belonging and 
improved health and wellbeing. Men particularly enjoy the opportunity to 'get out of the 
house' and feel at home in the Shed. 
Sheds attract men who tend not to be found in adult and community education and who 
are difficult to reach through community-based education, health and wellbeing 
programmes. An important aspect of this piece of work will be for the provider to facilitate 
and to offer learning and education to Shedders at a time, place and in an environment 
that is suited to Shedders. The Shed network functions across Kent. The priority group 
for this piece of work is focused on men, and in particular, men from the most deprived 
quintiles in Kent who are not currently in employment. However, Kent Sheds are also 
open to women, and will be open to those who do not reside in the most deprived 
quintiles, as well as those who are in employment, should they wish to participate, as 
agreed locally.",,,"South East","98000000 ","Craig Barden",craig.barden@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,MAIDSTONE,ME141XX,England,"03000 416723",,,,,01/04/2022,31/03/2023,21/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,39600,,25/02/2022,39600,"[Activmob CIC|1 Rescorla Barns, Rescorla, St Austell, Cornwall, PL26 8YT|COMPANIES_HOUSE|07204777|No|Yes]",,01/04/2022,31/03/2023,"CompetitiveQuotationNonOJEU ",,09:00

Brief Description of Requirement

Aims and Objectives of the Project
The aim of this research is to better understand the relative contribution of green choices to the achievement of increasingly ambitious levels of emissions reduction, at different geographical scales. We have a good understanding of supply side mitigation: the availability of technology over time, technology costs and associated emissions reduction potential. We need to develop a solid understanding of the emissions reduction potential of green choices at the global scale: at the level of adoption of new low carbon technologies, and the level of using energy, technologies or services more efficiently (deployment) and barriers to take-up and deployment. The aims of this project are to understand:
1.	The relative contribution of green choices to global emissions reductions.
a.	Assumptions surrounding the take-up and deployment of new low carbon technologies in key existing global emissions pathways and scenarios.
b.	The pinch points and risks to the emissions savings of new low carbon technology at both adoption and deployment levels including impact on global markets and supply chains and risks of carbon emissions outsourcing and identification of potential unintended consequences.
2.	How green choices, their availability and accessibility, and likelihood of buy-in and uptake vary in different geographic and socioeconomic contexts including, for example, country to country or city vs. national scales and the associated size of emissions reductions. We are interested in both a backward-looking and forward-looking assessment, in terms of what has been done where and whether there are socio-economic or regional trends in this, to what could be done where in future. We are also interested in notable examples that illustrate a potential for 'scale-up'.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Middlewick Range is situated on the outskirts of Colchester, postcode C05 7LX, and has been announced for disposal. To enable this disposal the capability will be transferred to Fingringhoe, with the site due for development in 21/22.

The additional live firing training capacity, that will be created by the supplementary range facilities at Fingringhoe, is an enduring requirement for the MOD.

The aim of the Project is to provide two additional firing ranges and supporting facilities at the Fingringhoe Range Complex to allow for the closure, and subsequent disposal, of 85 hectares at Middlewick Range.
The objectives of the Project are to:

a. Provide adequate range facilities to support use of the ranges, scaled for the number of personnel. The facility must support 2 x 30 personnel troops, workshop and store, toilets and vehicle parking and be Technical Advisory Section (TAS) compliant. The existing track is to be widened and resurfaced. Utilities shall be required.
b. Ensure that, outside of agreed periods, disruption to the operation of Fingringhoe Ranges is kept to a minimum during the construction period.
c. Ensure that the works are designed, constructed, commissioned and maintained to the appropriate standards and regulations during the construction and subsequent defects phase.
d. Optimise Through-Life Costs.
e. Link the Project and its delivery to the End Users' operational outputs.
f. The design of all engineering service systems shall be energy efficient and emphasise simplicity of layout and control. They shall include standard, tried and tested components to achieve a design life of 15 years' subject to planned maintenance and replacement required.
g.

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the CCS RM3764.3 Cyber Security Services 3 Framework.

Brief Description of Requirement:
To summarise, we require specialist cyber security, business analysis, stakeholder  engagement and device assurance scheme design capabilities to: 

• Review current device assurance arrangement for Smart Metering. The review should include:

  - Detailed engagement with BEIS, SSC and NCSC to capture key stakeholder views on the current scheme, what is working well and how it can be improved. We would expect the work to identify the key strategic drivers, priorities and challenges of the scheme. 

  - An assessment of the efficacy of the current approach in supporting the wider requirements, and continued evolution, of the smart meter security architecture. A particular focus of this element of the work will be managing change (both in terms of new operational requirements and evolving security requirements that impact device assurance). 

  - Review and analyse feedback received as part of the recent SSC survey (which will be provided to the successful contractor). 

  - Review other relevant assurance (both national and international) schemes to assess if lessons can be learned This aspect of the work should also include an assessment of the applicability of the NCSC's Principles Based Assurance approach.

  - Review of the current governance approach for device assurance within the wider context of its role in supporting the Smart Metering ecosystem, including risk-based decision making, assurance maintenance, re-certification of devices and the operational aspects of the scheme. 

• Produce a final report for NCSC, BEIS and SSC, summarising how the current scheme is supporting the requirements of smart metering, its ability to accommodate changes to the scheme and setting out actionable recommendations for improvement 
and evolution.

One of the potential processes identified as having the potential for automation is the creation of recorded flood outlines from historic photographs. 

The primary outcome of this commission is to complete an initial discovery piece of work, including a potential proof of concept, to investigate whether Artificial Intelligence and automation can be used to generate a 'first draft' recorded flood outline using a range of historic flood photographs. This work will potentially help save a significant amount of staff time in creating recorded flood extents after a flood event. This is currently quite a manually intensive process and so any improvements we can offer will be welcomed by area operations teams.

• a directory of service listings.

The current Local Offer is not meeting families' needs. It doesn't have all the required information; it's hard to find and understand the information that is there. The search function doesn't work well.

When families can't find the information they need, it puts a strain on busy teams at the council and other organisations, including health services. For example, families often apply for an Education, Health and Care Needs Assessment when they aren't eligible for one.

When families are confused about the services that are available to them, they get in touch with the professionals they've had most contact with (eg social workers).

Overall sample size will need to be sufficient to provide robust subgroup analysis. These attitudes and behaviours should include amongst others: taking personal responsibility for informing themselves about preparations for travel, the destination they intend to visit, entry requirements overseas and for returning to the UK, buying adequate travel and health insurance, which, if any, FCDO communications channels are used, FCDO social media awareness, specific FCDO comms brand awareness, awareness of local laws and customs and FCDO reputation. Our travel advice is guidance only and relies on travellers taking personal responsibility for their actions. Ultimately, it is their decision as to whether they travel to any given location. We will share the previous survey with the successful agency. Ordinarily we would want tracking to take place in March/April and September/October with the results delivered mid-June and mid-November respectively. 

The successful agency will have the capacity to undertake periodic polling on specific campaigns, if needed.

The question is whether there are structural shifts that may sustain higher prices, what caused this change, what are the future risks to the market and what impact might they have. This information is needed to help the UK better understand and manage the UK's net zero transition alongside ensuring energy security of supply in a global energy market and the UK's role within a global just energy transition.

This contract is a research project to produce analysis and a report that will benefit BEIS and HMG more widely by increasing the understanding of future gas market risks, enabling BEIS to better prepare for future gas market events and put in place mitigations to protect and prepare UK businesses and consumers. The project will increase the evidence base on gas market risks which will help to structure future BEIS analysis and policy proposals.

Reference: DN548629.
People accessing employment is a key area highlighted in national policies such as Valuing People Now, The Autism Act and The Care Act 2014. Dorset Council commissions a range of services for people (adults) living with learning disabilities and mental health issues and physical disabilities and has ambitious plans to commission a service that supports people in a holistic and strengths-based way, creating a clear pathway to employment and meaningful work placements. Historically, people who use Council services have remained NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training), and longer term this is likely to increase their reliance on funded social care services at a time when Council resources are under increasing pressure. 
The service is being commissioned primarily for people supported by the Council who are living with learning disabilities, mental health needs and physical disabilities. However other people with an eligible need may access the service. The Council recognises its duty under the Care Act to ensure employment and volunteering opportunities are available to people with disabilities and other vulnerable adults. The Supported Employment Service will ensure people access and maintain supported employment that is realistic and sustainable; supporting people to achieve economic wellbeing and social inclusion whilst maximising their potential as a person living in Dorset. 
The service will be sourcing and supporting a variety of work and work-related opportunities for people aged 16+ years with Learning Disabilities, Physical Disabilities, Mental Health needs, Autism and other support needs across Dorset. 
Tenderers are advised to read the Procurement Document (ITT) fully before preparing and submitting any bid.

This includes a review of different resource estimates for individual feedstocks and/or categories as well as the different factors that could impact on availability, highlighting opportunities and risks. Feedstocks associated with higher risk of land use change and other uses, such as food and feed crops, are to be considered but are considered a lower priority in view of current shares of waste-derived fuels in the UK and policies in place to promote their use further. The report will also set out what type of fuels may be produced from these feedstocks, including information on processing routes and greenhouse gas performance. Given the global nature of renewable fuels markets, the report should cover both feedstocks from domestic production and imports, differentiating clearly between the two.

The BEPO decommissioning process encompasses the reactor core, bio-shield and foundations. This specification relates to design of PP&E used to decommission the reactor core only. The decommissioning process is already well defined in the Decommissioning Programme and therefore the Consultant is required to produce scheme designs for the PP&E to support the existing decommissioning process rather than develop the process itself. This process is also reflected in the Decommissioning Safety Case. The functionality of the PP&E shall meet the requirements of the Safety Case and ensure that decommissioning of the BEPO reactor core is achieved safely. The following documents shall be used as the basis and starting point for the Consultant's concept design activities: Decommissioning Programme (Ref BOSS/SC/001/13 Issue 4) Decommissioning Safety Case (Ref BEP0/DSC/17/0001 Issue 2) Level 3 Radiological Risk and ALARP Assessment (Ref BEP0/DSC/17/0001/07 Issue 1) The current status of the reactor core and bio-shield (and hence the design start point) is described in Section 4 below. The end point is for the 6m3 ILW concrete boxes to have been filled, grouted, lidded and placed onto transport in readiness for egress from the decommissioning site.

"BHCC - 033824",Contract,"East Sussex County Council",Awarded,2022-01-31T09:31:30Z,"Pedestrian Crossing Program","Pedestrian crossing points are key to helping pedestrians travel safely around the city and the scope of this programme is to improve pedestrian crossing facilities thus improving safety, reducing accidents, improving perception of personal safety for cyclists and pedestrians to reduce car dependency and usage, encouraging more active lifestyles particularly for shorter journeys.  

Brighton & Hove City Council's (BHCC) Transport Projects & Engineering (TP&E) Team collates and assesses requests received for new or improved pedestrian crossings from both members of the public and local Ward Members each financial year.  For locations that meet the pre-assessment criteria a wide-ranging assessment is carried out and the location is assigned a priority score.  The locations are then ranked by their priority score (highest to lowest) and informs the Pedestrian Crossing Priority List.

Those crossing locations achieving a ranking within the top 10 will be prioritised for funding but this does not automatically qualify a particular location for implementation.  For example, the cost of a crossing facility at a particular location may be prohibitive or upon closer investigation it may become apparent that suitable pedestrian provision already exists in a particular location and therefore further investment would not represent good value for money.

The 'type' of crossing facility proposed is considered on a case-by-case basis by Highway Engineers. Often the most appropriate and cost-effective solution for locations can be pedestrian refuges or buildouts. Where larger scale facilities which are likely to exceed available budgets are required, such as full junction redesigns, schemes may be delayed until funding can be made available.",,"BN3 3BQ",,"71400000 ","Edward Dunn",OrbisSourcingSolutions@eastsussex.gov.uk,"County Hall,St. Annes Crescent",,LEWES,BN71UE,England,"07818 587500",,,,,28/01/2022,31/03/2023,05/01/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,75860.1,80000,28/02/2022,75860.1,"[PROJECT CENTRE LIMITED|2 Holford Yard
