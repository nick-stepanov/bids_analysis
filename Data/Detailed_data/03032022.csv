This is acutely important given the demise of the statutory careers service ended (Connexions) in 2012 and was replaced by the National Careers Service, which was primarily aimed at adults. Responsibility for careers advice was then transferred to schools/colleges and recurrent research papers have highlighted the issues that this has raised. 
Interaction with young people and career changers is crucial to ensure that HEE is able to secure the future workforce. The current HEE strategies are multi-factorial, including a focus on upskilling the current workforce, but none of these along will be able to meet our workforce demand. Indeed the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has also suggested that careers guidance should be started as early as primary school. 
Given the resources and staff available in the Careers Directorate and the number of schools/colleges in the North East/North Cumbria alone, it is strategically easier to target large scale events to engage with a wider potential argument. In many cases we are unable to support careers events in schools due to capacity of the team and schools increasingly facing issues taking students 3 out of schools due to timetabling, permissions, staff shortages and transport costs. *Something about Gatsby* 
Drama in education is a solution to these issues due to it touring schools and delivering a high impact performance within a short period of time -both resourceful for the schools and HEE careers team. By using humour, actors are able to raise the profile of a range of different, less obvious careers within the NHS, as well as highlight particular shortage areas in workforce.

Brief Description of Requirement

Innovate UK EDGE through its national network of 20 consortium partners runs a large number of conferences and events each year, and this is an area of increasing demand. We provide the capability for our partners to book meetings at face-to-face and virtual events (e.g. allowing attendees to book 1-on-1 sessions with the speakers after an event/webinar has finished).

At the minimum we require a tool to broker meetings, to enable continuity of this essential service for us and our partners. It could be part of a larger event platform with full virtual event hosting capability. Ideally, the solution will also be able to integrate with our Salesforce CRM for seamless data entry.

As IUK EDGE organises several high-profile events each year it is critical that these events are hosted, or at the minimum that meetings are brokered, on a GDPR / DPIA compliant platform that provides the functionality and professionalism that is expected. Therefore, enhancing IUK EDGE's reputation whilst minimising any GDPR / DPIA related risks. 

Consequently, Innovate UK EDGE is looking to purchase a user-friendly tool to broker meetings which is GDPR / DPIA compliant and is provided by the supplier as Software as a Service. It could be part of a cloud-based Event Platform which is GDPR / DPIA compliant and is provided by the supplier as Software as a Service and is also available as a Managed Service should event demand require Innovate UK EDGE to secure additional resource and support. It is desirable that any platform must be able to adapt and support future event demand as it is expected that in future due to the pandemic that EDGE will increasingly host hybrid events combining virtual and physical event attendance.

"IT-26-4621-P00004621 - AWARD",Contract,"Portsmouth City Council",Awarded,2022-09-26T13:52:59+01:00,"Temporary Accommodation - Support Services and Property Management - AWARD","Portsmouth City Council ('the council') is inviting tenders from suitably qualified suppliers to provide a support service for individuals and families living in temporary accommodation.
      
      The Service will comprise of accommodation based and non-accommodation based (floating) support services. Currently support is delivered to approximately 45 households, with varying degrees of support need and frequency of visits.
      
      In addition to the support element, the Council also requires a property management service for some of its furnished temporary accommodation. The Service will comprise of the management of approximately 45 units of accommodation, however this number may vary over the life of the contract.  
      
      The Service consists of these two elements under three Lot options:
      • Lot 1 ('contract 1'): Accommodation based support & non-accommodation based
      (floating) support;
      • Lot 2 ('contract 2'): Property management;
      • Lot 3: Combined bid for both lot 1 & 2
      
      Services are currently delivered under a single contract. A key driver for separating these elements is to allow greater flexibility for the support element and make best use of available resources. It also opens up the market to other potential bidders who may only be in the position to deliver services under one lot. Additionally the council are reviewing options to bring the property management element in-house. The Council will be undertaking an assessment in parallel with invitations and assessment of bids secured from the market via this procurement process.
      
      Providers can bid for lots one and/or two as separate bids. Providers are also able to submit a combined lot bid (lot 3) which clearly identifies the additional benefits and added value that would be achieved through contracting with a single supplier. The council reserves the right to award one or any combination of lots, or indeed not to award contracts in respect to any of the available lots.
      
      The council is targeting to have awarded both contracts on 1 Mar 2022 to allow for service commencement on 1 Jun 2022. The contracts will be let for an initial term of 3 years which may then run for a further 5 years in increments set by the Council to a total maximum term of 8 years, subject to performance and at the sole option of the Council. The estimated total value of the contracts for both lots is £900,000 over the initial term based on the total available budget. 
      
      - The estimated value of the contract 1 is IRO £150,000 - £200,000 per annum, between £1,200,000 - £1,600,000 over the maximum term of 8 years. 
      - The estimated value of contract 2 is IRO of £75,000 - £100,000 per annum, £600,000 - £800,000 over the maximum term of 8 years.
      
      The annual value of both contracts may vary over the initial term due to fluctuation in demand. An open book costing model will be used alongside the contract to agree any variations over the term.",,"PO1 2AL","South East","85310000 85312510 85323000 70333000 85312310 98340000 85312400 85311000 ","Procurement Service",procurement@portsmouthcc.gov.uk,"Guildhall Square",Portsmouth,Hampshire,"PO1 2AL","United Kingdom","023 9268 8235",,,,,01/06/2022,31/05/2025,27/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1500000,3000000,01/03/2022,0,"[EC Roberts Centre Ltd|84 Crasswell Street, Portsmouth, Hampshire, United Kingdom, PO1 1HT|NONE||No|No]",,01/06/2022,31/05/2025,"Open ",,12:00

The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

It is an independent statutory body. 

The SMC is establishing a Policy and Evidence Advisory Panel of subject-matter experts to provide advice on a range of issues that impact social mobility:

Academic roles:
1.	Education (Lot 1)
2.	Measurement (quantitative analysis) (Lot 2)
3.	Routes to employment and the labour market (Lot 3)
4.	Families expert (Lot 4)

Policy roles:
5.	Education (schools) (Lot 5)
6.	Education (further education) (Lot 6)
7.	Families expert (Lot 7)
8.	Levelling up - geographic/ place inequalities (Lot 8)

The panel will consist of both academic leaders in their field as well as seasoned policy experts. The panel will consist of both academic leaders in their field as well as seasoned policy experts. 

The final number of experts recruited will depend on the quality of bids received and budget considerations but is expected to be approximately 8 individuals.

Being an expert on the Policy and Evidence Advisory Panel provides a unique opportunity to help shape the SMC's mission of improving social mobility for all.  We intend to use advice arising from this contract to inform our thinking - we do not expect suppliers to engage on our behalf.

A key task will be to review and provide input into the Social Mobility Commission's annual statutory report, The State of the Nation.  This is laid before Parliament each year.  In 2022 we expect to launch the report in April, so this will be one of the Panel's first tasks.  On a more ongoing basis, we will request panel members to be a sounding board for us - on our research pipeline, our policy recommendations, as well as when we are scoping new areas that may have causal links to social mobility.  

Anyone holding a role on the panel will not be excluded from bidding for future contracts offered by the SMC. Nor will holding a role on the panel provide anyone with any advantages in being considered for future bids for SMC contracts. To avoid a conflict of interest, experts on the panel would not be expected to advise on work they have been separately contracted by the SMC to do. In this case, we would aim to allocate experts to work where there is no such conflict of interest.   

Length of Bids
A.	Bids should not exceed a total of 2 pages per role (excluding CV, publications list, declarations/annex).
a.	Any bids above that will not be considered. The font size should not be smaller than 11. Embedded links or files will not be considered.
B.	Bidders must also please complete and submit the 'Declarations' (Document 5).
C.	Bidders must also complete and submit the 'Conflict of Interest' (Annex One).

Bidders must submit their Bids before 12 Noon on Monday 14 February 2022, to: Colin.Seymour@cabinetoffice.gov.uk.

Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

The purpose of this research was two-fold, Firstly, to determine whether consumers and industry would be willing to make use of reservation agreements and then secondly and only providing that Kantar could demonstrate industry and consumer support,  for Kantar to carry out a trial of reservation agreements. Once this trial had been concluded, Government could then make a determination about an appropriate way forward.

Kantar successfully completed the first phase of their research carrying out research with industry and consumers. At the start of 2020, they submitted a report to MHCLG (now DLUHC) which summarised their findings and recommended that the work should proceed to a formal trial. In early March 2020, Ministers agreed that this work should proceed to a trial. However, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the housing market and then the subsequent recovery sparked by a stamp duty holiday distorted the level of transactions and meant that a trial during 2020 was not possible.

The US Network has provided Dental Insurance coverage for its Country Based Staff members (CBS) as part of suite of benefits for many years. The suite of benefits provided have taken on more importance with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA provided comprehensive reform of medical, prescription drug, dental and vision insurance across the US. The main goal of the ACA is to ensure all Americans have access to affordable insurance coverage. The current contract expires on the 31st of March 2022.

The nature of Dental Insurance and the size of the US requires that staff (and any qualifying dependents) have coverage across the 50 US States. In order to ensure geographical coverage and the optimum service provision and Contract Administration, we contract a benefits Broker.

Brief Description of Requirement

The aim of the work is to produce a set of outputs that can be used to support the development
of an innovation strategy for urban systems. The strategy needs to be representative of all

whether the strategy needs to be UK based or more localized by gaining a better understanding
of those local issues.

      Birmingham's population is younger than the national average, with a large proportion of the population being of a child-bearing age. Weight management services for new parents are limited, with poor attendance and completion rates. Children who have overweight parents are more likely to become overweight in adulthood. Thus, new parents maintaining a healthy weight has knock-on positive effects on their children.
      
      New parents are more likely to gain weight due to several reasons: (1) sleep deprivation is associated with weight gain, (2) increased stress is associated with weight gain, (3) increased mindless snacking, (4) less perceived time to exercise. Studies have reported that among women who have a healthy BMI prior to pregnancy, 30% have become overweight one year after giving birth. Although men have been shown not to gain as much weight as women, on average they do still gain weight after having a child. 
      
      The Council requires a supplier for the provision of a Tier 2 Weight Management service specifically designed to meet the needs of those residents who have recently become parents.
      
      This contract will be for a period of 4.5 months commencing 14th February 2022 until 30th June 2022.  
      
      The Council will be using its free to use e-tendering system (in-tend) for the administration of this procurement process and potential suppliers must register with the system to be able to express an interest.

Background
AWRP is a strategic asset that receives and processes up to 320,000 tonnes of waste each year, and is a key component of the Council's long-term waste and environment strategy. Comprising of a Mechanical Treatment Facility, Anaerobic Digester and Energy from Waste Plant, the site improves recycling capabilities, generates 28MW of electricity and produces 70,000 tonnes of aggregate used in the construction sector. 

The project is a collaboration between the City of York Council and North Yorkshire County Council. AWRP has been operational since 1 March 2018. 

The Government published its Resources and Waste Strategy for England in December 2018 which sets out how the Government will preserve material resources by minimising waste, promoting resource efficiency, and moving towards a circular economy in England. This was followed up by three consultations in 2019 and a fourth in 2020:
•	Consistency in Household and Business Recycling Collections.
•	Reforming the UK Packaging Producer Responsibility System.
•	Introducing a Deposit Return Scheme. 
•	Consultation on the Waste Management Plan. 

The Strategy and subsequent consultations could have a potentially significant impact on the PPP Contract and the operations at AWRP. The Council is seeking support from the Supplier about how best to navigate these reforms and undertake required changes to the PPP Contract.",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","79100000 ","Procurement Team",procurement@northyorks.gov.uk,"County Hall,Racecourse Lane",,NORTHALLERTON,DL78AD,England,"01609 533450",,,,,14/03/2022,13/03/2024,28/02/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,300000,,04/03/2022,300000,"[Ashfords LLP|Ashford House

The British Council creates international opportunities for the people of the UK and other countries and builds trust between them worldwide. We achieve this purpose through our work in the following three core areas also called Strategic Business Units (SBUs):  

•	Education and Society  

•	English and Exams 

•	Arts  

To do this, we have offices in over 100 countries and territories around the world, which are structured into eight regions:  

•	Americas  

•	East Asia  

•	European Union Europe  

•	South Asia  

•	Middle East and North Africa   

•	Sub-Saharan Africa  

•	Wider Europe  

•	UK  

Screening will be required across all these SBUs and Regions. Each SBU has slight differences in their operations which has been reflected in the screening requirements for our four risk profiles.  

In Education and Society, achieving the British Council's purpose involves the international sharing of knowledge, ideas and cultural expression. It also involves the exchange of experience and expertise in social and civil development.  

Within English and Exams British Council promotes more widespread and better-quality teaching, learning and assessment of English and helps people gain trusted UK qualifications as a gateway to international opportunities.   

Arts aims to better understand and share cultural policy through their program. This includes work in culture and development, capacity building, including and the role culture plays in international relations.

The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority (LCR CA), together with a consortium of partners, including Merseytravel, the six Liverpool City Region (LCR) Local Authorities and Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), have been awarded funding through the European Regional Development Fund's Sustainable Urban Development (SUD) programme and Transforming Cities Fund, to invest in a Green Sustainable Travel Corridors (GSTC) Programme, which aims to promote and incentivise sustainable travel, across the entire city region and includes associated biodiversity improvements. 

Consortium partners are delivering a series of nine work packages: a series of cycling and walking upgrades on key corridors that will make up the Liverpool City Region Strategic Cycling & Walking network. They aim to introduce clearly defined direct routes which utilise off-road and segregated routes to encourage increased uptake in cycling and walking in the region. Green infrastructure enhancements include the planting of street trees and management of natural habitats, new meadows and woodland creation. 

The overarching GSTC programme will deliver over 55km of cycling and walking upgrades on key corridors linking key housing sites in the region with employment and training opportunities and 49 hectares of new and upgraded habitats through the creation and management of new woodland, wildflowers and grassland and the planting of street trees alongside the cycling and walking routes. 

GSTC Work Package 1 relates specifically to the southern corridor between Liverpool City Centre and Garston. Where 6.8km of upgraded cycle and walking facilities will link new key housing sites, at Festival Gardens and Port of Garston, with major employment sites in the city centre and Estuary Commerce Park, in Speke. Additionally, 6ha of habitat creation and enhancement, including wildflowers, tree planting and use of recycled substrates, where appropriate, will create natural wildlife corridors outside of the established park areas of Festival Gardens and Otterspool Park & Gardens. Liverpool City Council (LCC) Highways are delivering a series of junction enhancements along the highway whilst LCC Parks and Greenspaces are delivering green infrastructure elements along the Mersey Waterfront.


The Proposed Brief

The current brief relates primarily to a series of physical infrastructure elements, between Armstrong Quay, at Riverside Drive, Otterspool Promenade and Beechwood Road South, Cressington, with option to include some additional landscape/habitat features if budgets allow.
