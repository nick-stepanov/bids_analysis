The outputs in conjunction with existing evidence may inform regulatory decision making on the use of breast implants on the UK market. 

There is a need to conduct research due to a rise in reported cases of Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma known as BIA-ALCL and other symptoms related to breast implants. 

The aim of the research is to gauge public perception of acceptable levels of risk amongst specific subject groups.

In all cases, we are interested in people who are pre and post-surgery. We want to determine how attitudes to risk may vary amongst different groups and at various different stages in their journey. 

We require a research organisation/Supplier to manage and deliver these research services, taking responsibility for (not an exhaustive list): participant recruitment including the payment of any incentive payments; sampling; questionnaire and script/topic guide design; fieldwork; analysis; and producing the reporting and data outputs. We consider a range of research methodologies could be effective in this delivery. The appointed Supplier should be experienced in handling research projects on sensitive subjects (especially in the healthcare sector) and with potentially hard-to-recruit participants.

We consider a range and/or combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies could be effective in this delivery, such as face-to-face, telephone, and online approaches including panels, tripod interviews, focus groups, and depth interviews. Research organisations/tenderers are requested to provide details of appropriate methodologies/approaches that ensure that the research aims and objectives are met.

Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

The Council has a strong track record of supporting local community and voluntary groups (Community and Social Enterprise Sector- VCSE) to deliver voluntary services, projects and activities in the community.  It has been delivering a Community Grant Programme since 2005.
      
      The Council is aware that over the past 5-10 years, it has been harder for the VCSE to access funding as traditional funding pots such as the Lottery have been reduced and re-prioritised. Covid -19 has had a devastating impact on the VCSE sector in terms of their ability to fund raise which has affected their income streams and as a result has impacted on the support that can be provided to local activity. A local lottery would be an alternative income stream for VCSE benefiting from a percentage of lottery ticket sales whilst at the same time it will enable additional income to be generated to support wider Council initiatives at a time of financial challenges. 
      
      It is expected that the ELM will be appointed in early 2022 with the Wealden Community Lottery launching in August 2022 and the first draw taking place in September.

They are involved in the implementation of new complaints and conduct legislation arising from police integrity reforms 2019, which commenced on 1st February 2020. A key element of the reforms is to carry out independent reviews of police complaints where the Commissioner has been assessed as the relevant review body and the complainant formally requests a review in respect of the Force's handling of their complaint.
For information, please find links to the Regulations below:
•	Police (Complaints and Misconduct) Regulations 2020: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2020/2

This will require a capacity to independently research and evaluate police complaints processes and procedures as they apply to individual cases and thereafter make recommendations to the relevant Police and Crime Commissioner who will then decide on the outcome of the review.
The Police and Crime Commissioners for Dyfed Powys, Gwent and North Wales are seeking to appoint an independent service provider to conduct independent reviews on their behalf.

Brief Description:
The overarching focus of this research is to ""ask don't presume"" as we often find that vulnerable transport users are not given a voice by key decision makers. It is also important to add that while this study hopes to help all vulnerable transport users, our central aim is to gather the concerns and lived experiences of women from a broad range of socio-economic backgrounds.

This research will support the creation of a potential new challenge centred around active travel and combo travel with a goal of making vulnerable transport users feel safer.

Currently Providers support Children and Young People with a range of Disabilities, including Children and Young People with physical and learning Disabilities, autism and challenging behaviours, and many children have multiple needs. They provide a range of Care Packages across Staffordshire which are tailored to the specific needs of eligible Children and Young People.

Similarly, SCC also has a legal duty to offer a range of commissioned community short breaks opportunities, ranging from community-based breaks of a few hours, to overnight short breaks for Children with Disabilities under the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children regulations 2011.  

This programme of support is known as 'Aiming High for Children with Disabilities' in Staffordshire, and augments our in-house and commissioned Overnight Short Breaks Units, and the support of Short Breaks Foster Carers in providing the range of short breaks for Children to give parents and carers a meaningful short break from their caring responsibilities in order that they can maintained for the long term.

SCC have previously commissioned a range of Providers from across Staffordshire to deliver Children's Community Support and Short Breaks on behalf of the Council, contracted as two separate support programmes.  

The Council has decided to commission 1:1 Lifeskills and Independence, which was part of the Children's Community Support and Short Breaks offer, as combined service under this Children's Community Support (including domiciliary) Service Specification. It is expected to be able to provide a more flexible, responsive support service that can draw on the Children, Young People and families' existing strengths, and focuses on development, independence, preparedness for adulthood, and provide cost effectiveness.

This includes to develop and reach joint solutions with the people the NPS supports and works with. Involving people who use NPS services in how they design and deliver them, is key to the aim of working together to protect the public and help people lead law abiding and positive lives. It is important to build a culture of including and listening to diverse sources of input and insight, to understand 'what works', and apply learning across the Service, enabling people to be their best and creating an open learning culture, listening to the voices, stories and lived experiences of service users. Working with people on probation in relation to what works in probation practice involves engaging in co-produced, participatory research that produces insightful findings that have a practical application.
The Strategy and Improvement team within the Probation Workforce Programme is establishing a Research Network, comprised equally of HMPPS staff members and service users or individuals with lived experience of the criminal justice system (CJS). Following selection of research network members - who will be selected by
the Authority, learning opportunities initially in the form of training will be required to establish all participants at a level of skills and understanding sufficient to undertake small scale, robust, participatory, co-produced research projects. Initial, bespoke, online training (with supplementary learning materials) is thus required in relation to individuals engaging fully in participatory, co-produced research design and delivery.
The Provider will deliver training to provide an awareness level appreciated of participatory, co-produced research methods that will be utilised within a probation service context. The key outcomes to be achieved shall include, but not be limited to the following:
By the end of the learning event(s) participants will have sufficient foundational knowledge to undertake primary research activities relating to participatory, co-produced research methods.
By the end of the learning event(s) participants will have sufficient foundational skills awareness to undertake primary research activities relating to participatory, co-produced research methods.
(a) the ability to understand and integrate resources gleaned through various means - online, at the library,
in archives, via interviews etc.

The successful contractor's performance on the contract will be regularly monitored in line with PGN 01/12. Contractors not delivering on contract requirements is a serious matter. It means the public purse is not getting what it is paying for. If a contractor fails to reach satisfactory levels of contract performance they will be given a specified time to improve. If, after the specified time, they still fail to reach satisfactory levels of contract performance, the matter will be escalated to senior management in CPD for further action. If this occurs and their performance still does not improve to satisfactory levels within the specified period, it may be regarded as an act of grave professional misconduct and they may be issued with a Certificate of Unsatisfactory Performance and the contract may be terminated. The issue of a Certificate of Unsatisfactory Performance will result in the contractor being excluded from all procurement competitions being undertaken by Centres of Procurement Expertise on behalf of bodies covered by the Northern Ireland Procurement Policy for a period of twelve months from the date of issue of the certificate.",,,"Northern Ireland","79530000 79540000 ",,justice.CPD@finance-ni.gov.uk,"Causeway Exchange, 1-7 Bedford Street",,BELFAST,"BT2 7EG","Northern Ireland",,https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/,,,,01/04/2022,31/01/2026,06/09/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,10000000,,15/03/2022,1500000,"[FLEX LANGUAGE SERVICES LTD|Twin Spires Centre, Belfast, BT13 2JF.|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,01/04/2022,31/01/2026,"OpenOJEU ",,15:00

The project will raise awareness of the latest technology and will be retrofittable to legacy manufacturing facilities. The technology will be able to provide a tangible benefit to the carbon footprint of a manufacturing site through data capture and visualisation and / or machine cognition.

The project will demonstrate how IIoT can be used in a manufacturing environment to understand, influence, and change the key levers in carbon reduction. A range of technologies will be implemented to understand energy usage, occupancy and asset parameters, environmental conditions, utilisation of micro grid technology and visualisation through a user-friendly dashboard. We are aiming to minimise or remove the requirement for fossil fuel dependency in the manufacturing environment. The facility is a demonstrator, and we would therefore like to show the various ways this can be retrofitted to a legacy manufacturing environment.

This tender is seeking to attract bids to supply, install and maintain multiple sources of renewable energy generation. These sources are divided into 4 lots of interest as stated below:

Lot 1	PV Solar
Lot 2	Static Battery Technology
Lot 3	Heat Pump
Lot 4	Innovative solution (this is an alternative renewable technology not covered by lots 1 to 3)

Mooring on land along the stretch of River Thames has increased in recent years, with numerous incidences of overstaying where mooring is permitted and illegal mooring in areas where mooring is restricted. The Council recently committed to introduce a new approach to mooring on it's own land, which will incorporate a combination of charged mooring locations, 24 hour moorings and locations where mooring is not permitted (outside the 24hr right of navigation mooring). 

The contract is offered at zero cost to the Council, with the supplier retaining the majority of the revenue generated and is expected to cover all costs associated with the  operation of the services required.  

The duration of the contract is 12 months, subject to the right of the Council (at its sole discretion) to exercise its right to extend the Contract by 12 months. The maximum length of the contract is therefore 24 months.

The eligible population of both Lots includes patients over the age of 12 diagnosed with diabetes and registered with, or eligible to be registered with a GP, as well as individuals within prisons, secure units and the armed forces.

The aim of the DESP is to reduce the risk of sight loss amongst people with diabetes by the prompt identification and effective treatment if necessary, of sight threatening diabetic retinopathy. 

This will be achieved by delivering an evidence-based service that:
•Identifies the eligible population and ensures effective delivery with maximum coverage
•Is safe, effective, high quality, externally and independently monitored, and quality assured
•Leads to earlier detection, appropriate referral, effective treatment and improved outcomes
•Is delivered and supported by suitably trained, competent and qualified clinical and non-clinical staff who, where relevant, participate in recognised ongoing continuing medical education (CME), continuous professional development (CPD) and quality assurance (QA) schemes 
•Has audit embedded in the service
•Works effectively with other stakeholders to ensure the care pathway is smooth and efficient.

There are 3 key elements of service delivery, namely:
•Call/recall for all people with diabetes invited for routine digital screening - this is currently undertaken on an annual basis but screening intervals are likely to extend to two years for people at low risk during the contract term in line with national guidance
•Digital surveillance where individuals need more frequent screening
•Slit lamp bio-microscopy (SLB) for those individuals where normal photography is inappropriate (e.g. those having cataracts).

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) does not form part of this Contract at this time, though this position may change over the life of the contract in line with national guidance. 

The Contract term will be 5 years, with an option to extend for a further 3 years at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. The Contracts will commence on 01/04/2022. 

The 8 year estimated expected contract values based on predicted activity levels are; 
Lot 1 = £11,311,233.60
Lot 2  = £10,985,831.92

The Contract will operate on a hybrid basis with a fixed ""block"" element based upon the average uptake of routine screening in the eligible population for the last 2 years plus a variable element for digital surveillance and SLB and a further variable element to incentivise routine screening uptake to 85%. Variable elements will be paid according to activity undertaken.

The Commissioner's ambition through the financial model is to encourage uptake of DESP to achieve or exceed the national achievable target of 85% uptake in routine screening (DE1).",,,"South West","85000000 ","Hannah Morley",scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"360 Bristol - Three Six Zero","Marlborough Street",Bristol,BS13NX,England,,,,,"The Services have been commissioned using the national service specification for DESP Services, localised where appropriate. 

National changes to screening frequency for low risk individuals are expected to be implemented during the contract term which will have an impact on activity. The subsequent impact on contract values will be agreed between the Provider and the Commissioner via contract variation.

Interested providers were able to bid for one or both lots.

Purpose: The purpose of this training plan is to detail the initial learning and development necessary for the AAIB engineering and data recovery inspectors to understand the data recording systems and data recovery opportunities available on a modern, large commercial aircraft with complex avionic systems in order to progress an investigation. Aim: The aim of the training is to provide opportunities to review and discuss modern, sophisticated data recording systems architecture, to recognise potential data extraction opportunities of modern avionics systems and to determine potential lines of inquiry that may be derived from recovered data. Introduction: The AAIB recognised a need several years ago, which has been reflected in the annual objectives, to provide training for engineers on fault diagnosis of modern large commercial aircraft avionic systems. This need identifies a knowledge gap which is increasing over time as aircraft avionics systems become ever more sophisticated and integrated. This training requirement is unique to the Branch and there is no commercially available course currently available to fulfil this requirement. A bespoke course will have to be designed and delivered in conjunction with an appropriate aerospace training organisation to bridge this knowledge gap. Airbus A320 Series: The Airbus A320 series has been chosen for this training because it is by far the most numerous, modern commercial large aircraft in the Airbus inventory. It also uses sophisticated avionics systems which are representative of the manufacturer's wider, modern commercial large aircraft fleets. Course title: Understanding the A320 Multi-Function Control Display Unit (MCDU), subsequent production of reports and Built in Test Equipment (BITE) Course duration: Two days per course. Number of courses and students: Two courses are required, each on a different date, to facilitate up to 10 students; however, this can be subject to change due to operational requirements. Course attendees will be invited from the Engineering and Data Recording inspectorate including PIs. Timing: If possible, the training is to be contracted before the end of FY 2021/2022 with delivery in April or June 2022. Course structure: The maximum number of training hours per day should not be more than 6 hours. A training hour means 60 minutes of tuition excluding any breaks, examination, revision, preparation, and aircraft visit. The course teaching time for each day may be subject to change dependent on student numbers. Instructors will be required to annotate the course paperwork where any deviations away from the Training Specification has occurred. Objectives: On satisfactory completion of the course, the students will be at a suitable standard to be able to access data from the A320 aircraft MCDU and discuss appropriate avionic system fault finding strategies with an operator's aircraft maintenance engineers and managers.

The work on the building is estimated to be completed in December 2021 and the Drug and Alcohol Recovery Service (DARS) will relocate from their current accommodation in Peterlee Health Centre to the building in Horden between January and March 2022.

A procurement exercise was due to be undertaken in 2021 for the DARS, with the intention being to incorporate the requirement for cleaning services for the recovery centres within the new service specification, rather than the current arrangement of Public Health contracting directly with cleaning service providers.  However, as the DARS contract is likely to be eligible for the new NHS Provider Selection Regime that is due to come into effect in 2022, an extension to the DARS contract of 18 months to 31 July 2023 was recommended by the Health and Social Care Category Board in May 2021 and subsequently approved by Adult and Health Services Management Team in June 2021.

The request is to negotiate with an incumbent DARS Cleaning Provider to put in place a contract from the date that the DARS moves into Horden Recovery Centre to 31 July 2023 to align with the extension period for the DARS, after which point the responsibility for cleaning of recovery centres will be included within the service specification for the DARS.  The previous provider for cleaning services for the East Durham recovery centre when it was located in Ridgemount House, Peterlee, has chosen not to quote this time due to the distance between their base and the site, therefore the alternative provider is Bettakleen who currently provide the DARS cleaning service to 2 other sites.",,,"North East","90910000 98341130 ","Christine Little",christine.little@durham.gov.uk,"County Hall",,DURHAM,DH15UL,England,,,,,,07/03/2022,31/07/2023,23/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,21252.49,14/03/2022,21252.49,"[BETTAKLEEN LIMITED|Digital House, 5Th Avenue Business Park,Team Valley Trading Estate

It will allow clear oversight of patient pathways by all clinical and non-clinical teams involved in preparing patients for surgery. Implementing a digital system will allow a streamlined process where low risk patients can be screened early allowing optimal clinician input and resources to be focused on high-risk patients. The digital solution will provide consistent decision support through clinically validated and peer reviewed algorithms. The digital solution will support a web-based version for direct patient interaction so will increase the amount of pre-operative assessments completed with reduced footfall through the department. Using the digital solution will improve pre-operative assessment clinic efficiency by increasing throughput, assessing patients in a timelier manner by targeting delays in the current process will help reduce morbidity and mortality rates from surgery, reduce hospital admissions and length of stay, reduce waiting list times, and improve theatre efficiency.
