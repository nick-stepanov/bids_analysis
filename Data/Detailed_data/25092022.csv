A find a tender award notice, reference 2022/S 000-029550 was published on 20th October 2022. For the avoidance of doubt, no new procurement process has been undertaken.

Capsule endoscopy is a diagnostic test used to examine the gastrointestinal tract and check for disorders and conditions such as Crohn&apos;s disease, polyps and malabsorption. The procedure is an alternative to traditional endoscopy and could provide a better patient experience.

The patient is prepared by attaching sensors to their abdomen. Sedation or anaesthesia are not needed before taking the capsule. The capsule is swallowed with water. The capsule has its own camera and light and takes a series of images. While the capsule passes through the body, it sends images to a data recorder which is typically worn in a shoulder bag, close to the waist. Patients can go about their normal routine and the entire procedure takes about eight hours.

Afterwards, images from the data recorder are downloaded and analysed to provide a report to the patient's consultant, who will review it with the patient. The capsule is disposable and will pass through the body naturally with bowel movement.

The procedure, and the reporting process, can be undertaken outside of a hospital setting. This can be more convenient for the patient, and free up hospital space.

Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust's Commercial Procurement Service (CPS) wishes to award a national framework agreement for the provision of a capsule endoscopy managed service which will allow NHS authorities and other public sector bodies to procure the services from a compliant purchasing framework.

Overview of Requirement
The Framework will run alongside four block contracts separately commissioned by each Local Authority within D2N2.  This Framework will be used to commission placements when a block contract is unable to meet a Young Person's specific requirements or has reached full capacity.

Supported accommodation placements will improve Young Person's skills in the following areas:

•	Sustaining a tenancy
•	Managing a budget
•	Engaging in the local community
•	Understanding how to access further support
•	Gaining independence skills 

The Framework will provide high quality, good value, supported accommodation for D2N2's Young People in care and care leavers.  The Framework will require the Contracting Authority and the Provider to work in together to ensure supported accommodation is available when required and meets each Young Person's individual needs.  

The key objectives of this Service shall be to: 

•	Provide Young People with accommodation and support at the point of need.

•	Provide supported accommodation where Young People feel safe, are protected from harm and safeguarding risks, and understand the consequences of risk-taking behaviour.  

•	Prepare Young People for sustainable independence through the provision of individually tailored support in high quality accommodation. 

•	Provide well trained Support Workers who will form strong, positive relationships with Young People to support them on their journey towards independence. 

•	Provide stable and consistent accommodation and support to prevent frequent placement moves and the unplanned departure of Young People from their placement.

•	Improve value for money by reducing the Contracting Authority's reliance on high-cost individual placements.

•	Achieve positive outcomes for Young People.  Please see Section 2.4 of this specification for further details.

Bidders MUST already have the Accommodation requirements in place at the time of submitting their Bid.

The service and accommodation requirements are further detailed further in Part 3 Specification of the ITT documents.

As such the full regime set out in the regulations will not apply to the award of the Framework Contracts. Consequently, the procurement process adopted by the Commissioners has been developed in accordance with Regulation 76 of the regulations and in particular in accordance with the fundamental public procurement principles of transparency and equal treatment. For the avoidance of doubt this means that the Commissioner has not adopted an open procedure, framework (as defined in the Regulations) for the undertaking of this procurement process.

Lot 4	 = 5,928,000
TOTAL	 = 65,249,600

OPERATION OF FRAMEWORK
The Commissioner reserves the right to open a Lot or Lots and run an open competitive tendering process to replace existing Framework Service Provider due to failure/poor performance/material breaches etc. 

There will also be the option of opening up a Lot or Lots to add an additional Service Provider (or the highest ranked previously unsuccessful Bidder) where there are capacity issues within that Lot. 

The Commissioner reserves the right to add a Lot or Lots for additional service requirements and run an open competitive tendering process to award Bidders onto this Lot/s.

Contract Awards
The Contracting Authority may award individual Contracts through a 'Matching' process.

The Contracting Authority may award specific Contracts by direct award where appropriate.

Number of Successful Providers
Bidders are invited to bid for any number of Lots and there is no limit on the number of Lots Bidders can be successful in. 

Each Bidder will be ranked according to the number of points they have scored in the evaluation process for each Lot they have bid for.

There is no minimum or maximum number of Providers that may be successful in each Lot. The number of successful Bidders for each Lot will be dependent on the number of Providers required to meet the bed capacity requirements for each Local Authority in that particular Lot. Where a Local Authority area has their bed capacity requirement met, no more Bidders can be successful for that Local Authority in that particular Lot, no matter how high they are ranked.

The future objective is to run a competitive tender process to source a suitable training provider by 2023 to support the Fire Safety department to meet their statutory requirements.
LFB intends to award a contract, subject to a 10-day standstill period, without prior publication of a contract notice.

The BBC is bound by its Charter to safeguard the long-term value of its archive for the public. Digitising more of the archive will fulfil this objective and make historic content more widely accessible to future audiences. This ITT relates directly to the digitisation of BBC generated audio content over the next 3 years. BBC Archives Technology & Services (AT&S) holds a large collection of audio tapes which have yet-to-be digitised. Within this audio collection reside recordings spanning from 1930s to the 2000s. Most of this content is programme output from BBC radio networks, and unbroadcast live music performances & interviews. Much of the content identified for digitisation represents the only known copy available, often referred to as Single Copy Masters (SCM). The proposal is to digitise a range of content held in both Quarter Inch and DAT formats. 
The Contract will be for an initial term of 3 years with options to extend by two twelve month extensions, to a maximum of 5 years. It is expected to begin on 30th September 2022. The contract value does not represent committed spend, instead it represents the maximum spend that may be made over the total contract term. A site visit to Perivale is offered to all registered Tenderers. The date for the visit is Wednesday 13th July 2022 1.30pm - 4.00pm. The visit will provide Tenderers with an opportunity to visit the Perivale site and ask any questions relating to this ITT and the requirements. As space is limited, Tenderers are requested to please nominate a maximum of 2 key personnel to the BBC via the Bravosolution message portal no later than 15:00hrs on Wednesday 6th July 2022. All visit attendees will be required to complete a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) prior to the visit and photography will not be allowed.

In 1982 Barton Whaley proposed a general theory of deception [1]. Despite being general purpose and more tailored toward psychology and human factors this was used as the basis for a description of various deceptive categories used in the sensor deception work  which ran from 2017-2022. 
A principal part of the deception work under Redacted was delivered via an EMR contract by the University of Liverpool (UoL). The outcomes, reports, presentations and training events showed 
various promising advances toward quantifying and mitigating deceptive action against sensors. In their development of these solutions, they went some way to a mathematical description of types 
of deceptive behaviour. It is on this foundation that we wish to build initial work to be delivered in SFM Counter Deception.

Multiple data feeds from each of the Provider organisations across the system are extracted from source systems into CSV files which are then fed into the solution.  The purpose of the Dashboard, is to take the data and provide a &apos;live&apos; whole system (health and social care) view of pressure and system flow across the urgent care system to enable operational leads to identify and address pressures as early as possible.

The key objectives of the HWE ICB Urgent and Emergency Care System overview solution are:

-	To provide all system partners with a shared view of 3 x place-based and a single consolidated ICS UEC system pressure

-	To enable IT Inter-operability with existing system partner IT systems to maximise automated collection of data in real-time

-	To provide flexible system configuration to enable data fields to be added/deleted, pre-configured reports to be changed/created, and data to be extracted for analysis purposes

-	To easily generate daily Operational Pressures Escalation Levels (OPEL) reports that are pre-populated with both data and text

The Authority set out the requirement for an innovative supplier who will work in partnership to continue to evolve the solution throughout the contract period to meet new guidance and system demands with consistent engagement with the ICB and the wider Hertfordshire and West Essex ICS to achieve this.

A compliant procurement process was undertaken via the NHS England Health Systems Support Framework to identify a supplier who delivered the most economically advantageous solution to deliver the services.  The Health Systems Support Framework was chosen as the most appropriate route to market which would best meet the Authority&apos;s objectives following a detailed options appraisal of potential routes to market.

After a high-profile national campaign, the winners will be decided by public vote, giving National Lottery players and the public a say in how National Lottery money is awarded.

In May 2023 five shortlisted projects, per region, in the 16 ITV regions across England, Northern Ireland, parts of the Borders in Scotland and Wales, and a total of 15 projects across the rest of Scotland will be put forward for a public vote (95 projects in total).

The website must also host information and videos about the projects that the public can vote for and provide information for the public to access about what the programme is and how they can get involved.

The Fund is therefore seeking to procure a service provider to design and host The People&apos;s Projects website.

A 70m length of beach level revetment originally formed with grouted masonry is present at the western end of the sea defence structure. Driven sheet piling retains the revetment which has been overlain with a sprayed reinforced concrete encasement to provide remedial protection against scour and undermining. The sheet-piling and inclined face of the revetment are in very poor condition. Steel section thickness loss is locally severe. Reinforcement bar has become exposed by scour action to sprayed concrete on the revetment rising above the sheet piling. Both sheet pile tops and exposed rebar have been trimmed where they present a hazard to users of the beach. This condition presents a significant risk of potential compromise of stability to the sea wall, and/or of potential breach beneath the wall to draw fill material from behind, as was the case in 2020. Such a breach would present serious risk to the integrity of the public highway and to the integrity of the public sewer rising main.",,,"South West","45000000 ","Sian Rees",Contract.Management@torbay.gov.uk,"TOWN HALL,CASTLE CIRCUS",,TORQUAY,TQ13DR,England,"01803 207334",,,,,01/11/2022,31/01/2023,05/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,440000,460000,23/09/2022,450000,"[MILLENNIUM MARINE CONTRACTORS LIMITED|Unit 5 Wills Road

In addition it is expected that the consultant will undertake a detailed and meaningful consultation with different groups of individuals (including children and young people), community groups and with the Council's Elected Members, which will provide the Council with a rich dataset that could inform the next generation of investment into outdoor play provision in the city.

The Council has set a maximum budget of £40,000 for the Project.
Please see separate documents attached for more Information.

This increased gas price is flowing through to the electricity market and non-gas fired generators are now benefiting from extraordinarily high electricity prices when their cost of operation is unchanged. Under the direction of Ministers, officials have been instructed to seek to negotiate revised contracts for difference with renewables obligations generators to sever the link between electricity and gas prices to reduce consumer bills as soon as possible. This needs to be undertaken at great pace to mitigate costs this winter, meaning negotiations are already under way. This will require deep policy development and analysis to bring together policies that can deliver on government's objectives. However, it will also require deep commercial energy expertise and commercial negotiation experience. Whilst officials under the direction of Ministers will oversee and direct negotiations this individual will bring his decades of commercial experience in the energy sector to bear in negotiations to challenge senior energy company executives (CEO level), sell the benefits of the government proposal and set out the commercial realities of a failure to accept. He will also play a key role in shaping negotiating strategy ahead of such sessions. This individual is exceptionally well placed to do this having consulted across and negotiated with the commercial energy sector for decades and has previous experience of supporting government policy development at the highest levels.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

Context

The UK's research and innovation system tackles national and global challenges, supports economic growth, productivity and cultural richness, and fosters private R&D investment. 

In order to remain sustainable, our research and innovation system must be able to meet present R&D needs without depleting its ability to meet future needs (as set out in the Government's R&D roadmap, Plan for Growth and Innovation Strategy). Achieving this requires sufficient financial inputs as well as a critical mass of talent and capability, a thriving research environment, and action to address environmental sustainability. 

However, as the Government advances its plans to make the UK a science superpower and increase public spending on R&D, research-performing organisations are reporting financial pressures associated with covering long-term costs and investing in the underpinning capability needed to respond quickly to new opportunities and priorities, and research leaders have expressed concern that the costs of research are rising faster than inflation.

Aim 
 
The aim of this study is to develop and demonstrate a methodological approach that will enable UKRI to better understand the underlying costs of research, how these costs are changing over time, and the drivers behind the observed trends. It will provide robust evidence (quantitative data and qualitative analysis) of the drivers of change and the extent to which the costs of research have changed over the past 10 years. 

Bidders should develop a proposal that outlines a robust methodology that would support an exploration of the changing costs of research in UK universities and UKRI-funded research institutes. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

One of the largest prevention programmes of its type in the world, the programme is designed to help prevent and detect early signs of heart disease, kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes and dementia.
• In Oxfordshire, and since 2013, the Council have adopted a service model where GP Practices are the only service provider. As of 1st April 2021, this was commissioned with 68 GP Practices via a Call-off Contract (Lot 1 - NHS Health Checks) under the Dynamic Approved Provider List Agreement (DAPL) for the Provision of Community Primary Care Services. Approval has been granted by Public Health DLT for a new DAPL Agreement Framework for a period of four years, with new Call-off Contracts being issued to begin on 1st April 2022. To date, 65 out of these 68 GP Practices have applied to deliver the NHS Health Check Programme until 31st March 2026.
• The effect of COVID-19 on Primary Care settings ability to deliver the NHS Health Check Programme, when compared to pre-pandemic, has been extremely challenging as they have rightly had to mobilise and respond to the pandemic as it evolved, including leading on mass vaccination. At its peaks, NHS England and Improvement have issued Community Service Prioritisation Framework Guidance to Primary Care requesting it to pause provision of NHS Health Checks.
• When Public Health England (PHE) updated its NHS Health Check Restart Preparation guidance to Local Authorities in April 2021, they recommended applying the principle of proportionate universalism, delivering Checks in a way that prioritised resources and effort by inviting those who are most likely to be at higher risk of CVD. The guidance also stated that where Primary Care is the dominant Service Provider of NHS Health Checks, as it is in Oxfordshire, the Local Authority should now consider alternative models of delivery when making local decisions on the future provision of the service.
• The aim of this contract is to develop and implement a new Supplementary NHS Health Check Service in Oxfordshire that will begin to restore provision of NHS Health Checks using a proportionate universalism approach.",,,"South East","85323000 ","David Hodgson",David.Hodgson@Oxfordshire.gov.uk,"2nd Floor,County Hall, New Road",,OXFORD,OX11ND,England,07759118831,,,,,01/10/2022,31/03/2026,06/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,950000,,20/09/2022,950000,"[ICE CREATES LIMITED|Unit 3,Abbots Quay, Monks Ferry

This is an ICS level review. NBT has one on site facility whilst the UHBW Pharmacy currently operates technical services in 4 locations within the Trust main precinct.

The option appraisal is being undertaken:
•	To address a recognised unmet need in the preparation of aseptic products at UHBW and NBT and the wider NHS, as identified by the NHS Improvement Aseptic Services Review and the NHS England Releasing Time to Care agenda.
•	To address expansion in new and more technically demanding therapies
•	To address capacity and contingency issues locally, and to explore increasing capacity to support the wider NHS  
•	To identify how this enhanced service can add value across the system
•	To identify opportunities for partnership working with neighbouring Trusts and commercial suppliers
•	To identify system level support for NBT aseptic activities
•	To enhance value added to the region through NBT and UHBW joint aseptic service, non-sterile manufacturing, repacking/over labelling.

The scope of project includes the following:
•	A full market analysis of the current and future opportunities with the following considerations
	Delivery of a UHBW and NBT solution
	Delivery of an Integrated Care System (ICS) wide solution
	Onsite or offsite solution
•	An Options appraisal is to be carried out to look closely at possible solutions to future proof technical services in the region.
•	This information will then inform SWOT analysis for each of the options chosen; with one option put forward the bidder will closely look at resources required to make it happen and benefits to patient care. 
•	The end product required is an Outline Business Case (which must include a Revenue Business Case) for preferred option supported by strong evidence. Strategic outline Business Case must also be written. This information will be used by UHBW and NBT to write a Full Business Case.",,"BS1 3NU","Any region","71600000 71621000 73000000 73200000 73210000 73220000 79410000 79411100 79415000 79419000 90713000 ","BWPC Klaudia Palasti",Klaudia.Palasti@nbt.nhs.uk,"Princess Campbell Office (opposite Pathology)","Southmead Hospital",Bristol,"BS10 5NB",ENG,"'+44 1174142680",,,,,06/10/2022,05/03/2023,15/06/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,45000,19/09/2022,45000,"[Akeso & Co|Akeso & Company

At the heart of the Green Flag Award winning open space sits an educational resource centre providing conservation and wildlife activities for school children and training opportunities for adults.

The site has been managed and run on behalf of the council for many years by conservation charity TCV (The Conservation Volunteers) through partnership agreements. It is now about to enter a new era with full, long term management responsibility given to TCV with the signing of a lease for the site.

Along with the management of Railway Fields TCV will provide conservation outreach work in many of the borough's open spaces, utilising its wide network of volunteers to creatively manage and enhance the biodiversity of Haringey's green spaces. Currently these volunteer sessions take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Volunteering opportunities contribute towards the Council's overall vision of working with communities to make Haringey an even better place to live. With volunteer help a 'cleaner and greener Haringey' is achieved, whilst making a positive contribution to the biodiversity of green spaces.

To increase volunteering we want to offer residents the opportunity to volunteer their services to improve biodiversity and conservation in the borough's parks at the weekend, under the supervision of a third party organisation. 

These sessions will not only improve the physical infrastructure of the borough's parks and open spaces but will enable volunteers to learn new skills whilst keeping physically active. 

Due to the Pandemic, and the desire for more volunteering opportunities, this requirement will run from 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2023.

This is changing with the new targets that will be set through the Environment Act (2021). The additional targets on particulates will require a broader approach to addressing air pollution. This approach will still require a focus on transport but will also need to address domestic and industrial combustion as well.

In order to explore potential options in relation to air quality, a paper was produced for the WMCA Board in February 2022. The recommendation was that a West Midlands Air Quality Framework be developed, highlighting the work that could be taken forward regionally and developing cost benefit analysis for different interventions. This would need to take account of local priorities and responsibilities that will continue to exist through Air Quality Management Plans, as well as identifying the areas where national action would need to be taken.

The WMCA requires consultancy support to develop the initial options paper, produced in conjunction with the University of Birmingham. In particular, we require the following:
1.	A  secondment into the WMCA to fulfil the role of Air Quality Framework Programme Manager  This would be with immediate effect until completion of the framework, scheduled for February 2023. It is expected the secondment would be for four days a week for the duration of the contract.

A number of studies have highlighted the importance of maintaining a connection with a person who has self-harmed as a protective factor against repeated suicide attempt. Individuals who are admitted to the emergency department or attend their GP with suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm are at high risk of attempting or re-attempting suicide after discharge. As described in the National Suicide Prevention Strategy and National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health, continuity of care and smooth transitions can minimise this risk.

The Psychological Medicine Service Safety Planning Outreach Work is a pilot project and part of the Wave 4 Suicide prevention work. It is for those adults who have been assessed by the East Berkshire Psychological Medicine Service as safe to be discharged back to primary care following an episode at A&E for self-harm or suicidal thoughts and deemed safe to work on their safety plan with the Primary Care Safety Planning Outreach worker(s).  

The aim of the service is to offer a follow up to support with developing a safety plan and making a connection with relevant community support services for the individuals referred.

Safety plan interventions will focus on support options in the individuals' own community drawing from Third Sector services, Local Authority provision and Primary Health Care services. 

The Safety Planning Outreach will be a face to face follow up whenever possible. Online and telephone contact can be used where required and this will also depend on the persons preference and any pertinent risks identified in any face-to-face interventions. 

The Safety Planning Outreach Worker(s) will in collaboration with other community resources: 
•	Promote connection and reduce isolation
•	Improve coping skills
•	Signpost to other services and sources of support
•	Provide educational strategies to help with difficulties that triggered self-harm

Crucial to the role of is an awareness of local Third-Sector services, grass root services and other primary care services. The intervention can be delivered by a skilled individual who has experience of working with people with mental health issues or lived experience. The worker(s) do not need to be registered mental health workers.

The service will not provide psychological therapy or crisis support and it is not an emergency service. It is an additional rather than alternative service for support and encourages people to engage with a safety plan. As such, as long as a individual is not already receiving support from secondary mental health services (an exclusion criteria based on the higher support needs of secondary mental health service users); there is no contraindication to existing plans.",,,"South East","85000000 ","Hannah Morley",scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Fitzwilliam House, Skimped Hill Lane",,Bracknell,"RG12 1BQ",England,,,,,"The Contract is anticipated to commence on 1st October 2022 for an initial term of 12 months, with the option to extend for any period up to a further 12 months, as defined and at the sole discretion of the Commissioner.

Documentation is available at:\\r\r
https://procontract.due-north.com\\r\r
\\r\r
In line with Blackpool Council's Customer First and JobCentre Plus customer-focused ethos, the provision of an appropriate security presence must be balanced with a positive and engaging visitor experience, therefore it is important to recognise that Security staff will be referred to as Customer Care Officers and will play a vital role in the customer access areas of JobCentre Plus and Customer First at Municipal Buildings.\\r\r
\\r\r
Whilst maintaining the security of the building and safety of Blackpool Council and JobCentre Plus staff and their customers is the fundamental basis of this contract, this should not be the 'visible' element to visitors to the building.  We therefore expect Customer Care Officers to act primarily as welcoming custodians to greet visitors warmly and provide help and assistance in directing customers to the relevant service or appointment and then out of the building again in a friendly and efficient manner, which by default will minimise any frustration experienced by clients and reduce the opportunity for undesirable behaviour to occur in the first instance.\\r\r

They help to support the primary care workforce of today and tomorrow by training with the necessary skills, values, and behaviours for the NHS.

In supporting, leading, and assisting the delivery of the NHS Long Term Plan and the We are the NHS: People Plan 2020/21, there needs to be a continued strengthening of the education and training infrastructure to support new role and multi-professional team development, systematically and at scale in primary care.

Integrated care systems (ICSs) are partnerships of health and care organisations, that come together to plan and deliver joined-up services, and to improve the health of people who live and work in their area. They will assume a statutory footing as Integrated Care Boards from July 2022. Building strong integrated care systems everywhere: guidance on the ICS people function (August 2021) describes how NHS leaders and organisations will be expected to work together and, with their partners in the ICS, to deliver 10 outcome-based people functions from July 2022.

The ICS Level Training Hubs network is vital to transform primary care, through developing the current and new workforce required to deliver world class patient care across an ICS.

As such, Health Education England has awarded a Contract for the Training Hub across South West London.

The therapy will be provided within the Council's Early Help Hubs and can be offered either virtually or in person which will be dependent upon the preference of the child and the therapist availability.

Many children and young people who have witnessed or been a victim of abuse can often display their trauma through angry and aggressive behaviour which increases the likelihood of social care involvement and family breakdown. This service will be an important element of the City Council demand management strategy by reducing the numbers of young people stepping up to social work services.

The purpose of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is to serve the public interest by setting high standards of corporate governance, reporting and audit and by holding to account those responsible for delivering them.

In February 2021, the FRC published the revised Operational Separation Objectives, Outcomes and Principles  (the 'Principles').  Through Operational Separation, we intend to:
i)	Improve audit quality by ensuring that people in the audit practice are focused above all on delivery of high-quality audits in the public interest.  
ii)	Improve audit market resilience by ensuring that no material, structural cross-subsidy persists between the audit practice and the rest of the firm. 

The revised principles for operational separation of the audit practices have voluntarily been adopted by the largest four audit firms in the UK. The objective of operational separation is to ensure that audit practices are focused above all on delivery of high-quality audits in the public interest, and to improve audit market resilience by ensuring that there is no subsidy between the audit practice and the other service lines.  

Through the principles the FRC limits the scope of service that can be delivered by firms' audit practices mainly to undertaking statutory audits and related work. However, to deliver on a statutory audit especially for large and complex audited entities, the audit practice will need expertise which may not necessarily be located within the audit practice but may have to be borrowed from the other service lines in the firm for example: actuaries, valuers, IT specialists etc. In accordance with the Principles, we would expect the firms to charge these expert resources at arms' length prices (similarly if auditors work on engagements/ projects in other service lines then they would also need to be charged at an arm's length price). This will ensure that there is no subsidy between the audit practice and the other parts of the firm, and thus that audits are priced to reflect the economic reality. 

The aim of this project was  to engage an Expert Reviewer on transfer pricing, who will review the four largest audit firm's transfer pricing methodologies and policies for operational separation.

The transfer pricing expert should undertake a design effectiveness review of the transfer pricing methodology and policies used by the four largest audit firms in implementing the  Operational Separation Principle on arm's length pricing.

The report should detail:
1.	For each firm, the appropriateness of and the risks and issues arising from the firms' methodologies and policies for transfer pricing. 
2.	A comparison between the firms' arm's length pricing methodologies and policies to form a view as to whether, overall, there is a level playing field, given the firms' differences in approach.
3.	An opinion on whether there is any potential for improvement, and related recommendations.
