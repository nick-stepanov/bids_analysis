Overview:
Furness College currently comprises college offices, reception, foyer, and bar to the A floor, offices to the B & C Floors, and roof top flats to the D Floor.
 
The scope of works is to convert the existing Furness College C Floor Offices into seven Apartments with between nine and ten bedrooms per Apartment block.  The current RIBA Stage 2 proposal totals 65 bedrooms.  Each bedroom will be furnished with a fitted bed, desk, and wardrobe, with individual Wi-Fi access point and data connection; whilst each flat will be fitted out with a communal kitchen/living space and shower rooms.
 
The provision of new kitchens, shower rooms and the inclusion of washbasins in each bedroom will require new Soil and Vent Pipes to be installed and connected to the existing foul drainage system below ground level.  Core drilling through the concrete floor slabs will be necessary for the drainage systems to be commissioned and new pipe boxings, bulkheads, and false ceilings will need to be constructed on the A & B Floors.  To limit disruption to the occupants of the B Floor, some staged completion and decanting of staff may be necessary.
 
New L2 fire detection and alarm systems will be installed to the Apartments.
 
The construction work is planned to take place during the summer of 2022 but the campus will remain live with staff and students still living and working around the site.
 
Construction cost estimate for the scheme is currently in the range of Â£1m to Â£1.3m.

The Council is looking to appoint a suitably qualified consultant to carry out an Integrated Water Management Study (IWMS) including Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA).
      The studies will investigate all aspects of the water environment and ensure that water infrastructure can be managed sustainably alongside the level of growth being identified as the Local Plan is developed, with consideration of the possible challenges posed by climate change. 
      The studies will help Milton Keynes Council improve our understanding of flood risk management within the study area and the interactions between the surface water drainage, fluvial networks, potable, non-potable water and wastewater networks. 
      The purpose of the SFRA is to inform the decision makers' knowledge of flooding, refine the information on existing flood maps and determine the variations in flood risk from all sources of flooding across and from the area. Those will form the basis for preparing policies for flood risk management. The SFRA will inform the Sustainability Appraisal (incorporating the SEA Directive) of the Local Plan and will provide the basis from which to apply the Sequential Test and Exception Test in the development allocation and development control process.
      A robust evidence base will support and promote the wider understanding of integrated water management in the Borough and is essential for developing and adopting local planning policies, supporting other strategies and project across the Council and with partners, and enabling sustainable growth of the Borough through to 2050.",,"MK9 3EJ","South East","90700000 90712000 90711400 90713000 ","Klaudia Kulczyc",Klaudia.Kulczyc@milton-keynes.gov.uk,"1 Saxon Gate East","Silbury Boulevard","Milton Keynes","MK9 3EJ","United Kingdom","01908 691691",,,,,11/07/2022,28/02/2023,13/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,0,07/07/2022,62050,"[Jeremy Benn Associates Limited|1 Broughton Park, Old Lane North, Broughton, SKIPTON, North Yorkshire, United Kingdom, BD23 3FD|NONE||No|No]",,11/07/2022,28/02/2023,"Open ",,12:00

This study identified several economically viable heat network scenarios that also offered significant carbon reduction and wider socio-economic benefits for the city. 

Wolverhampton City's Heat Network scheme is aiming to develop a heat network within the city of Wolverhampton, utilising an Energy from Waste (EfW) plant as the preferred primary heat source. Following successful detailed feasibility studies, a technically optimised and economically viable project has been identified, which CWC now wishes to take forward to the Detailed Project Delivery (DPD) stage.

CWC has received funding from BEIS (Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy) via the Heat Network Delivery Unit (HNDU) to assist in taking the project to the DPD stage. This stage precedes the commercialisation of a preferred project option.

The Scope of this Invitation to Tender (ITT) is to undertake all work that is required to secure approval to proceed with the development of a heat network through delivery of an Outline Business Case (OBC). It outlines requirements covering technical, financial, legal and disciplines as per the Heat Networks Delivery Unit (HNDU) framework.

Brief Description of Requirement

Workspace Booking System

The application is required in order to replace the existing system which no longer meets the needs for hybrid working in the context of dynamic teams and changing physical environment (office space reconfiguration).  The system needs to be intuitive from a user's perspective, available via a responsive web application and a mobile app, configurable and meeting the organisation's Future of Work requirements - This is referring to our requirement to restructure how UKRI workspace is laid out, this may mean moving desks around, changing the use of space etc. The solution needs to be adaptable to allow us to update to reflect these changes. Key tenets of the Future of Work are: 

â¢ We will have to commute to work less often, saving us money and cutting our carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), thus supporting our UKRI environmental sustainability strategy

â¢ We will be more motivated, healthier and better connected - because of the greater flexibility of hybrid working that makes it easier to achieve a good work-life balance

â¢ We will be able to use the appeal of hybrid working to attract the most talented people with fewer location restraints and from more diverse backgrounds

â¢ We will be able to be more productive and perform better as individuals and as an organisation, with the increased job satisfaction that comes from that

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

This Contract will be for 3 years with the potential for +1 +1 years optional extensions. The Contract will start on 23rd March 2022 and the end of the Contract will be 22nd March 2025 should both the options to extend be utilised the Contract will end on the 22th March 2027.

The bootcamps offer free, flexible courses of up to 16 weeks for adults aged 19 or over who are either in work, self-employed, recently unemployed or returning to work after a break.

NTCA and the NELEP have secured a combined Â£7.4m  directly from the Department for Education to support the delivery of Skills Bootcamps in the NTCA region and wider NELEP geography. This is a significant investment in our region and has the potential to deliver new opportunities to generations of adult who may have been previously left behind. 

Skills Bootcamps aim to secure benefits for adults aged 19+ by giving them access to in-demand skills training and a guaranteed interview for a more sustainable, higher-skilled job and higher wages over time. The benefits for employers include helping them fill specific skills shortage vacancies, enabling them to become more productive, more quickly.

The overall aims of the Skills Bootcamps are:
 
- to deliver flexible training programmes lasting up to 16 weeks, based on employer / sector 'in-demand' skills needs which may be either regulated (i.e. qualification based) or non-regulated (e.g. based on alignment with industry standards) enabling adults (19+) to do training around work and other commitments, looking to gain work, additional responsibilities, or access new opportunities and will offer a guaranteed job interview (in the case of a new job) to individual participants on completion of the course; 
 
- to address the needs of adults (19+) who are full-time and part-time employed, unemployed, returning to work after a break or self-employed, and provide individuals with wider access to opportunities to retrain, update or formalise their skills or acquire specialist skills;
 
- to address the needs of employers and the wider economy, to deliver targeted interventions to meet short-medium term demand to fill vacancies and drive productivity. They will help fill medium-higher level vacancies and bring individuals closer to better jobs, by linking them with line of sight to a job/ different role, additional responsibilities or new opportunities/contracts; and
 
- to help fill vacancies and bring individuals closer to better jobs (including those currently in employment), by linking them with line of sight to a job / different role, additional responsibilities, or new opportunities / contracts.
 
We are keen to see innovative proposals of realistic and sustainable options that demonstrate commitment from all sides to a successful outcome.

The Centre is funded with UK aid from the UK government.

The Centre works to change how the world prepares and pays for disasters. Identifying, planning for, and financing disasters before they strike saves lives, reduces suffering, and protects livelihoods and economies, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable communities. The Centre brings countries together with international development, humanitarian, and private sector organisations to find solutions and advocate for change. We find ways to stop disasters devastating lives by supporting countries and the international system to better manage risks. To do this, the Centre provides technical assistance, builds knowledge, catalyses innovation, and creates partnerships across the development, humanitarian, and financial sectors.

The Centre's work has never been more crucial. As the Centre evolves beyond its start-up phase, our communications efforts will be critical to the Centre's next stage of organisational growth. We are a dedicated, growing team who are committed to our values of quality, impartiality, creativity, and empowerment.

Scope of Work

The Centre's communications function cuts across all organisational goals and is a key part of delivering the Centre's strategy and strategic communications objectives which are:
- Increase understanding of best practice in disaster risk financing and how to achieve impact
- Build the profile of the Centre and its staff as impartial experts in disaster risk financing 
- Support Centre thought-leadership to be internationally recognised as driving change through applied research and evidence, experimentation, and learning
- Position the Centre as a positive disrupter at the forefront of efforts to reform how the world plans and pays for disasters and tackles the growing impact of climate change and increasing cost of disasters around the world.
- Generate a perception of the Centre as a trusted, empowering, 'go to' partner, who individuals, organisations and national governments want to collaborate with

The Centre requires the support of a full-service communications agency to provide a broad range of services as we enter a new period of growth. See Terms of Reference for more information.

We are keen to understand the characteristics and behaviours and how we might approach groups of young people.
This partner will be experienced in higher education statistics (for example, those provided by HESA and UCAS), will have conducted similar work before and to provide relevant references.

Aims
To reach a greater number of enquirers by expanding reach to a greater number of leads who 'look like' they are Bedfordshire students;

To boost the recruitment of the traditional school/college leaving market, where we have seen a decline in recruitment over a number of years.

Objectives
To identify:
School and college-leaving audience and market segments which mirror but also build on those Bedfordshire has been successful in engaging with in the past;

New audience and market segments of applicants and student who won't have previously engaged with us but who may have the potential (specifically around our regions (Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, London; plus areas in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex etc within an hour's drive/commute from Luton/Bedford);

Application behaviours of groups of higher education applicants who may be persuaded to apply to the University of Bedfordshire;

Improvements for the focus, target and effectiveness of our communications to future enquirers, applicants and offer holders.â
We are looking for the project to:

Focus on data-evidenced quantitative profiling;

Deliver and prospect score existing and new market segments;
Give us a strong platform for conversion activities; and so
Increase the number of applicants aged 20 or younger by 10%;
Increase the recruitment of main campus home UG students aged 20 and under at the time of enrolment by 5%.
The outputs, detailed in specification, will need to be able to be able to be readily communicated with different parties across the University, as well as informing marketing and recruitment activities.",,"lu1 3ju",,"72316000 73210000 ","Andrew Kingston",andrew.kingston@beds.ac.uk,"University Square",,LUTON,LU13JU,England,01234400400,,,,,01/08/2022,31/12/2022,01/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,,08/07/2022,39466,"[SMRS Ltd|2 Express, 3 George Leigh Street, Manchester M4 6BD|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,01/08/2022,31/12/2022,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

Site locations will be confirmed with the successful provider(s) during contract award, however, it is expected that a gaming vehicle will be required to attend each District/Borough on a minimum of 2 occasions during the contract period. Delivery will be primarily Monday to Friday, however the Council may require some provision to be at weekends, to be agreed with the successful provider(s). Depending on the success of the project and the availability of the provider, Kent County Council may look to add additional days within the maximum budget available. 

Vehicles will be required across various locations on agreed days, locations may include Youth Hubs, KCC site locations, and youth engagement sessions. The provider should have vehicles that are accessible for both wheelchair users and children and young people with disabilities for example children with sensory perception difficulties, autism. Examples of adaptations below:
â¢	An individual with mobility issues - might require the provision of a mouse/keyboard and controller support, could provide an ergonomic mouse.
â¢	An individual with colour blindness - provide games which support colour blindness settings
â¢	An individual with deafness - provide games which offer captions (if appropriate)
 
Mains power will be available at the site locations.
Providers will need to have a range of suitable games that are classified as for ages 7+ only. For the avoidance of doubt only games classified for age 7+ will be made available as part of this contract. 
Across the 24 days, a vehicle will be expected to attend each of the 12 districts in Kent for a minimum of two days each, site locations to be agreed on contract award.
Vehicles are expected to be onsite primarily for 6-hour day sessions, which will take place any time between 9am and 6pm. Start and finish times will be agreed with the Council representative. In some circumstances, there may be a requirement to attend a youth hub between the hours of 7.30pm and 9.30pm, to be agreed with the Council on award of the contract.
The successful provider will need to work flexibly with Kent County Council who will arrange the locations during this period. 
It is expected that the provider will manage session durations in line with demand on the day of attending the site. Indicatively, during busy times we would expect children to have access for 30 mins - 1 hour but this is to be flexible based on demand.
The supplier must have undertaken risk assessments as agreed with Kent County Council.",,,"South East","92330000 ","Sam Wright",sam.wright@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,13/07/2022,31/08/2022,08/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,24576,49999,12/07/2022,24576,"[TechZone|48 Teapot Lane

- At least 65 optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) sensors and electronics to be used for magnetoencephalography (MEG) 
- An adjustable helmet(s) to arrange the sensors around the head of adults and children 
- A MEG-compatible chair for patient and helmet(s) support 

These items will be part of facilities for brain imaging at the Centre for Human Brain Health. The items will be combined in order to detect neuronal dynamics as well as localize neuronal signals in the brain. 

We require the OPM sensors to have sensitivity below 15 fT/sqrt(Hz). The sensors will be used in the OPM lab at CHBH. The lab is in the proximity of elevators. Therefore, we require that the sensors have operating range of at least Â± 100nT and the dynamic range of at least Â± 10nT with good linear response in that range. Regarding the bandwidth, we require that the system can record oscillatory brain activity (3-100Hz); ideally 1-100 Hz. 

The helmet(s) should allow sensors placement within millimetres form the subject's scalp. Participants for OPM-MEG research will be of all ages. Therefore, it will be required that the sensor array can be adjusted easily between different head sizes. The helmet(s) should allow the array of sensors to conform rapidly to the subject's head. We require that the helmet(s) is able to accommodate at least 60 sensors. 

To obtain precise source localisation, we require that the sensors in the array have well defined placement and the position of each sensor can be established with 1mm precision. We require that the information on each sensor's placement can be automatically stored in the data output file for each measurement. 

The system should also include a chair or a bed that has supports to fix the helmet in a desired position. The chair should be able to sit adults as well as children. The chair should be compatible with ultralow magnetic field environment requirements, be sturdy and comfortable. 

We require all the items to be safe to operate on human subjects. The recording sessions are expected to last 1-2h, during which wearing the helmet should be comfortable for the subject. We require that sensors to not overheat during this time. 

We request the electronics of the sensors to be fully integrated, simple, ready to use and easy to scale up. It should allow us to drive the sensor, retrieve data and interface the sensors with computers. The Data Acquisition unit/OPM controllers should have additional analogue and digital inputs and outputs. Additional head-position indicator (HPI) coils with a driver will be a benefit. Additional benefit will be if the format of the output files (raw and meta data) is compatible with conventional MEG devices and ability to import the files directly into MNE Python based software.

The site is located off the A509, London Road, Milton Keynes, MK16 (as per the attached red line plan). This land is due to be developed as a School site with a Community Health Hub located adjacent. The build project will need to be delivered by September 2024.
      
      We have been working with Nick Crank, MKC Senior Archaeological officer to determine the extent of works required. The attached RPS plan shows the proposed excavation area & trenches in green. The compressed geophysical survey is also attached for information.
      
      In view of the above information, we require a suitably qualified and experienced archaeologist (to be part of the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists Registered Organisations scheme) to undertake the necessary archaeological works and I would be grateful if you could provide an itemised quote to include the following: 
      
      1.Preparation of a written scheme of investigation (WSI) to be approved by Nick Crank (Senior Archaeological Officer, Conservation & Archaeology MKC) prior to site works commencing. 
      
      2. 2% trial trenching subsequent to the geophysical survey should be carried out in these areas, this should help rule out the presence of any significant buried archaeology. This equates to a total of around 300 linear meters of trenching (at 1.8m width) across the two areas indicated, focusing on the agricultural fields. The geophysical survey (attached) has revealed some anomalies (discussed in 5.1.21) which may be archaeological within the site, so some of the trenches should target these features.
      
      3. Production of report including assessment of significance and suggested mitigation (if significant archaeology encountered). 
      
      4. Two bound copies of the report are required to be submitted to Nick Crank (Senior Archaeological Officer, Conservation & Archaeology, MKC) for final approval and for deposition in the Historic Environment Record.

The objectives of this Service are to:

â¢ Develop and deliver a marketing and engagement strategy, utilising a range of content and media channels to reach a larger population of potential foster carers for the GM LAs.

â¢ Generate high-quality leads, at appropriate volumes in line with the GM's recruitment target, which are passed to the LAs seamlessly, who will then take forward the enquiries.

â¢ Provide marketing and data insight and expertise to support the LA Fostering Teams, supporting the development of a high quality foster carer recruitment journey.

To achieve this, there are three main strands of work:

1. GM-wide Foster Carer Recruitment Campaign

2. Shared Foster Carer Recruitment Website

3. Customer Journey Support including a shared CRM

More details are provided in Section 4: Requirement / Specification. We reserve the right to award a contract just for items 1 and 2, and remove item 3 from the scope of work.

Each GM LA will continue to have their own local marketing campaigns, so the service provider(s) will also need to work with LA partners to ensure that the GM-wide marketing complements and strengthens local activity, as well as draw on local marketing expertise.

This project will be based on strong partnership working, and bids from consortia as well as individual organisations are welcome.

The budget available for this project is Â£250,000 and we expect tenders at this value, and at least Â£100,000 should be reserved for actual marketing activity / media buying. Tenders exceeding a total value of Â£250,000 and that have less than Â£100,000 allocated to media buying will not be considered.

The contract is expected to commence on 1 July 2022 and last 18 months. There is provision to extend the work by two 6-month periods, in case there are delays, but there would be no change to the budget. The GMCA reserves the right not to award the CRM element of the offer as it is undergoing a review of existing internal systems that may also have been invested in that may give the project more longevity.

Under the OCPP, the UK is partnering with countries to exchange UK science, research, technical and development expertise to address marine environmental challenges across three key themes: marine pollution, marine biodiversity, and sustainable seafood.

One element of the OCPP is to support partner countries to influence and educate audiences on ocean science, including within the education sector. The aim of this contract is to produce a series of educational videos appropriate for use in primary 
schools in Sri Lanka (ages 6-10 years) to support learning on climate change in general, with special focus on the impact that climate change can have on the marine environment, particularly on important habitats such as coral reefs, coastal mangrove forests and seagrass meadows. 

The series is structured as four (4) separate video clips, and each clip is a lesson built around a theme title and a set of keywords, as follows:
- Lesson 1: what is climate change?
[keywords: CLIMATE, CLIMATE CHANGE, GLOBAL WARMING]
- Lesson 2: climate change and humans
[keywords: FOSSIL FUELS, CARBON DIOXIDE] 
- Lesson 3: climate change and the marine environment
[keywords: CORAL REEFS, MANGROVES, SEAGRASS] 
- Lesson 4: what can we do to limit the effects of climate change? 
[keywords: RENEWABLE ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, SUSTAINABLE] 
A script has been pre-drafted by Cefas (see separate attachment) which provides a guidance for the voiceover narration for each lesson, timed so that each video clip runs for approximatively 3-5 mins. We expect that the narration draft text may need to be slightly adapted to suit age and culture requirements. We also expect that the videos will be produced using creative, attractive, age appropriate animations, but we are also open to other ideas. Ideally, we would require the narration 
to be produced in collaboration with Sri Lankan voiceover actors as well as suitable sound effects and or music. There may be a need to produce the videos in English, Tamil and Sinhala languages.

The videos should also include the option to turn subtitles on/off, for full accessibility and consider colour blindness needs. The videos need to be formatted to be hosted on YouTube or Websites.
