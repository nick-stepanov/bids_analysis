The current and next generation of workers face a challenge of an unprecedented scale, and requires a solution that utilises innovative technologies, and a strategic use of digital channels and platforms to support agility of delivery on a population scale, complemented by more targeted one-to-one support where needed.
Cambridge City Council is the lead partner in a project that has developed a bold solution to meet the scale of the challenge posed by Covid-19 upon young people, delivered through a smart, universal passport to learning, skills and opportunity. CPRoL will provide a unified, place-based approach to improving skills and career outcomes, particularly for those with low social mobility. It engages leadership at a local level, connects existing networks of employers, formal and non-formal learning, and a technology platform that uses data from these providers to create digital pathways to more inclusive employment.",,,England,"80000000 ","Amy Kenny",Amy.Kenny@cambridge.gov.uk,"Cambridge City Council",Guildhall,Cambridge,"CB2 3QJ","United Kingdom","'+44 7718664779",,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=8876be30-007a-ec11-8110-005056b64545 ",,24/02/2022,24/12/2023,16/02/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,29000,,17/02/2022,29000,"[Conscious Communications|St John's Innovation Centre

In this instance, Leicester City Council led this joint procurement on behalf of both Authorities.

We sought to commission a service provider to deliver a health trainers service to offenders on community orders or license across both Local Authority populations (within Leicester and Leicestershire). Health Trainers services support adults who wish to make a change towards a healthier lifestyle but who are unlikely to make and maintain this without individual support.

The Authorities wish to ensure that procurement opportunities are open to small and micro local enterprises and voluntary and community sector organisations and appreciate the very important role these play in the local economy. Tenders from these organisations were particularly welcomed.

The proposed Contract will be for an initial period of 3 years to commence on 1st April 2022, with an option to extend, subject to satisfactory performance outcomes and agreement by the Authorities, for a further period or periods, up to a total of 24 months, taking the contract term, including all optional extensions, to a maximum of 5 years.

It is the Authorities' preliminary view that TUPE is likely to apply in respect of this Contract.

Leicester City Council conducted this procurement under the Light Touch Regime for Social and Other Specific Services, as set out in the Public Contract Regulations 2015 (PCR), at Section 7 (Regulations 74 to 77) and Schedule 3. The procurement process was not conducted under the Public Contract Regulations 2015; however, it was similar to that of an Open procedure. The Process, unlike an Open Procedure, included the flexibility, as allowed under the Light Touch Regime with various evaluation stages as detailed in the Invitation to Tender documentation.

Our purpose is to be an organisation that improves lives rather than focuses on services. This includes enabling and supporting people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) to take a full and active part in community life.  There is a statutory duty to provide an Advocacy Service to looked after children, children who are not looked after but are in need, and to care experienced young people, for both formal and informal complaints under the 1989 Children Act.  Additionally, the Act states that children and young people should be able to secure the support of an advocate in putting forward their wishes and feelings with regards to a change to be made in the service they receive, or the establishment they live in, without this having to be framed first as a specific complaint. There is a statutory duty to provide an Independent Visitor service outlined within this specification under the Children Act 1989 - New section (23ZB) and subsequently amended by the Children & Young Persons Act 2008. Local Authorities are required to appoint an Independent person for children and young people looked after whenever an authority considers an appointment to be in the best interests of a child.

These include internal teams, the public, innovators (funded through the programme and otherwise), investors, policy makers, and the energy networks themselves.
Innovate UK is progressing on its journey to becoming a data-driven organisation. With the Ofgem programme just starting, we have an opportunity to look at how we better capture, analyse and use data to offer additional value. With this we want to consider how approaches could be applied and scaled across the whole organisation.

Brief Description of Requirement

This study aims to analyse the market potential for sub-orbital launch from the UK.

The government's Spaceflight Programme aims to create conditions enabling the UK to be the first country in Europe to achieve commercial spaceflight - generating growth for the UK's economy and establishing the foundations for ongoing market growth and commercial sustainability by 2030.

The sub-orbital market is one that has not been explored in detail by previous UKSA studies. The aim of this work is to fill the evidence gap, to explore the suborbital market in the UK. To understand what currently exists, what exists elsewhere and what could exist in the UK.

By understanding where the demand falls, as well as the UK's strengths, weaknesses opportunities and threats, the Government can maximise the benefits for the emerging UK suborbital market and improve the UK's global competitiveness through informed decision making.

During the 2019/20 contracting year a comprehensive review of all mental health contracts commissioned by BNSSG's predecessor CCGs took place examining the services delivered, activity, outcomes and equity across BNSSG.  Alongside the review, the Community Mental Health Framework was published nationally.  This document set out the ambition for a wholescale transformation at a community level (excluding crisis and inpatients) of mental health services, including a significant enhancement to lower level mental health support which could be led by, or in conjunction with, the Voluntary Sector rather than delivered solely by an NHS Trust.

In April 2020 BNSSG CCG therefore decided to extend the existing contracts whilst a local model for the CMHP was developed.  An initial BNSSG model and timeframe for implementation is now in development, however, a further extension to contracts is required in order to avoid gaps in service during implementation and allow for further opportunities to be explored to develop integrated commissioning solutions.

If the CCG had not awarded contract extensions it would significantly increase health inequalities, leaving gaps within the pathway, without a clear alterative in place. Without a clear direction of travel, services may lose staff at a time when people with mental health problems are at their most vulnerable due to COVID-19.  Ending of contracts would not support the system's strategic direction and would not support people with mental health needs, who are particularly disadvantaged during the Covid-19 pandemic.  There has also been significant public and patient involvement in the consultation for the CMHP - over 40 events took place over a 3 month period.  During, 2021-2022, a process took place to further review all the contracts alongside our six maturing Integrated Care Partnerships in BNSSG.  As a result of this review, it was agreed contracts would be extended for a further year to support the development of our local community mental health framework models.

Nottinghamshire County Council is inviting suitably qualified organisations or consortia to submit tenders to provide supported accommodation and tenancy support to young people, aged 16 plus.   Young people are eligible to access 16 plus supported accommodation are follows;
•	Looked After Children moving on from residential care or foster care as part of a planned move or following a placement breakdown
•	Care Leavers up to the age of 25
•	Homeless and vulnerably housed 16/17-year olds 
•	Homeless and vulnerably housed 18-21-year olds with additional other vulnerabilities 
Nottinghamshire Council is looking to continue to drive service improvements and achieve improved outcomes for young people by redesigning the 16+ supported accommodation services.  Currently services are commissioned via two routes: a framework agreement that is due to end in July 2022, and an approved provider list established in 2018 for young people with more challenging behaviours or high risk profiles that are unsuitable for the main provision.  These existing contracts and individual placement agreements will draw to a close and be replaced by a new supported accommodation suite of services.
The scope and nature of the services required by the Council are set out in more detail in the Specification. The service is required across the whole of Nottinghamshire County (excluding Nottingham City) and will be commissioned as 5 separate lots based on location as follows.
Lot 1 Broxtowe, Rushcliffe and Gedling
Lot 2 Mansfield
Lot 3 Ashfield
Lot 4 Newark and Sherwood 
Lot 5 Bassetlaw
The service will be provided within the accommodation settings, the young person's home and any other appropriate location to suit the young person. 
The number of contracts will be limited, where practical, to two for any bidder.   However bidders are strongly encouraged not to limit their bids to just their preferred lots, and should bid for any they have the capacity to deliver.  
The contract will commence from 01 August 2022 for a period of 5 years to 31 July 2027. There are three twenty-four-month extensions available.

MIDDVN001-DN585027-37741504,Contract,"Mid Devon District Council",Awarded,2022-02-15T08:40:38Z,"Telephony/Unified Communications Solution","Over the last 20 months' Mid Devon District Council (MDDC) has faced significant challenges due to the Covid19 pandemic. The Council has been faced with  

1.	radically changing our service delivery model
2.	balancing shifting customer and staff expectations 
3.	modernising current working practices 
4.	maintaining financial sustainability

All of the above occurred before we were able to invest in our infrastructure to provide seamless communications between staff and with our customers.

With the shifted expectations on contemporary working environments and practices, and in conjunction with our Transformation Programme we are seeking a modern and resilient telephony provision with Unified Communications.  

Our existing systems need replacing in order to deliver a truly modern and unified communications framework through which we can deliver our services to the public.  We plan to replace our existing on-premises PBX, Meridian switch system and our Avaya IPOCC contact centre with a cloud based VOIP solution.

We operate out of various sites, so it is essential to ensure staff are able to move between sites and home whilst keeping their telephone number and functionality.

We are looking to achieve the following from replacing our existing Telephone and Contact Centre solutions:

Functions Enhancements
•	Unified Communications and Collaboration tools
•	Enhanced Mobile/Agile Working
•	SIP Endpoints (softphone, mobile device Apps and 'hard' desk phones)
•	Improved reporting on call handling, volume, usage and cost breakdown.

System Availability & Enhanced Support
•	Contemporary System Architecture
•	Improve system lifetime (PSTN retirement)
•	Improved Redundancy/Flexibility (Business Continuity)

Cost
•	Reduced/Efficient system administration
•	Reduced call costs
•	Reduced licencing and line rentals.

ORR/CT/21-77,Contract,"OFFICE OF RAIL AND ROAD",Awarded,2022-02-14T12:47:56Z,"Advice on factors influencing the growth of rail freight","Great British Railways - The Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail 

The Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail made a number of commitments on rail freight, including: 
•	a statutory duty for GBR to promote rail freight to secure economic, environmental and social benefits for the nation;  
•	a new rules-based track access regime; 
•	support to rail freight growth through more flexible use of train paths, simpler ways of charging and building on longer term contracts to support investment by operators; 
•	a national freight coordination team;  
•	embedding freight into strategic decision making, including Incorporating freight into the new 30-year strategy; and  
•	setting a rail freight growth target, as was done in Scotland for CP7. 

What rail freight growth targets the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland will set is not yet known.  We anticipate that we will need to take these into account in our CP7 final determination and in the requirements we set for Network Rail in PR23.   

2023 Periodic Review  
The Office of Rail and Road has started the process for determining the funding needed for Britain rail network from 2024-2029.  The process, known as the 2023 Periodic Review (PR23), sets a five-year settlement that will determine the level of funding the infrastructure owner (Network Rail/Great British Railways) should receive for its operation, maintenance and renewals activities and what, in return, it should be required to deliver from this over five years from April 2024, known as Control Period 7 (CP7).   

ORR's process will also provide a framework through which ORR will hold the infrastructure owner to account for delivering these during CP7. The UK government has indicated in the Williams- Shapps Plan for Rail that Great British Railways will be held to account for delivering commitments that Network Rail enters into for CP7. This ensures there is clear accountability for delivery and transparency about whether it is achieving this, and stability for investment during a period of change.   

PR23 will respond to the challenges facing the railway, and the planned reforms as the Williams-Shapps Plan is implemented. It will support the delivery of a more integrated railway that delivers improvements for customers, both passengers and freight.
