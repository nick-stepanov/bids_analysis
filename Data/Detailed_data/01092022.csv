\r
The CPCA intends to procure high quality adult education and training. CPCA are seeking to build effective contractual relationships and continue to implement local flexibilities through our devolution agreement. Successful training providers will deliver contracts for services that meet our quality standards and delivery expectations aligned to the skills needs of the CPCA region. Through the tendering process successful providers will demonstrate an understanding of our local authority areas, the needs of resident learners and employers, and how they would work alongside our FE Colleges and Local Authority grant funded organisations to add value to the local curriculum offer for CPCA residents.\r
\r
From the 2019/20 academic year, the CPCA has held responsibility for the regions share of devolved Adult Education Budget (AEB) and how it is delivered. The AEB aims to engage adults and provide them with the skills and learning needed for work or further learning. In addition, it will improve employability skills including communication, self-confidence and attitude to work and enable people to contribute to the social wellbeing of their community.\r
\r
In addition to the AEB, further government funding from the National Skills Fund: Level 3 adult Offer has been delegated to the CPCA for Level 3 Courses for the 2022/23 academic year.\r
\r
The CPCAs vision is to increase skills and career progression through a network of providers operating as a 'skills escalator', in enabling adults to increase their skills levels, their productivity, and quality of life, by progressing from lower to higher levels of learning and earnings.\r
\r
A headline focus of this Commissioning round is to:\r
â€¢ Increase the proportion of Peterborough and Fenland residents with a Level 3 qualification\r
â€¢ Reduce the number of Peterborough and Fenland residents with no formal qualifications\r
â€¢ Target residents living in the relatively most deprived postcodes in the sub-regions, including wider Cambridgeshire and parts of Cambridge City\r
\r
CPCAs overall commissioning approach will involve a combination of plan-led commissioning with grant providers and procured provision delivered through Contract for Services. This opportunity is concerned solely with procured activity.\r
\r
We expect that funding for the new Multiply program will be allocated to the CPCA for a three-year period from 2022/23 - 2024-25 academic year. Please be aware that at the time of publication, funding for Multiply has not been confirmed however is being included in this procurement to enable us to efficiently plan for and procure providers ready for launch in Autumn 2022.",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and The Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West","80000000 ","Chantel Allott",chantel.allott@cambridgeshirepeterborough-ca.gov.uk,"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority","72 Market Street",Ely,"CB7 4LS","United Kingdom","'+44 1480277180",https://cambridgeshirepeterborough-ca.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=d910a063-7a7f-ec11-8110-005056b64545 ",,01/08/2022,30/07/2027,13/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,30/08/2022,4500000,"[Back 2 Work Complete Training|Building 4 Universal Square, Devonshire St, Manchester, Greater Manchester, M12 6JH, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][Capita|65 Gresham Street, London, Greater London, EC2V 7NQ, United Kingdom|NONE||No|No][eVolve your future Limited|Unit 44, Enterprise Centre East Northants, Michael Way, Warth Park, Raunds, Northamptonshire, NN9 6GR, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][GNR Training Ltd|Coleman Street, Parkgate, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, S62 6EL, United Kingdom|NONE||No|Yes][Ixion Holdings (Contracts) Limited|Black Country House, Rounds Green Road, Oldbury, West Midlands, B69 2DG, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][Learning Curve Group Limited|1-10 Dunelm Rise, Durhamgate, Spennymoor, Durham, DL16 6FS, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][MPCT|MPCT HOUSE, OAK TREE COURT, MULBERRY DRIVE, CARDIFF, South Glamorgan, CF23 8RS, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][Pathway First Limited t/a Pathway Group|Amington House, 95 Amington Road, Birmingham, West Midlands, B25 8EP, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][PeoplePlus Group Ltd|19-20 The Triangle, NG2 Business Park, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, NG2 1AE, United Kingdom|NONE||No|No][The Portland Training Company Limited|Mandale House, 28 Bailey Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, S1 4EH, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][Runway Training Ltd|190 High Street, Tonbridge, Kent, TN9 1BE, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][Seetec Business Technology Centre Limited|Main Road, Hockley, Essex, SS5 4RG, United Kingdom|NONE||No|No][Steadfast Training Ltd|5 Enterprise Way, Spalding, Lincolnshire, PE11 3YR, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][TCHC|21 Station Road, Watford, Hertfordshire, WD17 1AP, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][The Construction Skills People Ltd|Unit 1 The Bridge Business centre, Beresford Way, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, S41 9FG, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No][The Skills Network|Abbey Court, Selby, North Yorkshire, Y08 8RY, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No]",,05/09/2022,04/09/2027,"Negotiated ",,12:00

      o Information on key languages for translations
      o Reference to key books, articles and legislations. The list is not exhaustive.

Services will be provided from 3 adult and paediatric hubs, either as a joint bid between two organisations (one covering adult services and one covering paediatric services) or as a single integrated service bid from the same organisation, covering both adult and paediatric services. Services will be selected to offer geographically equitable access to minimise patient travel times whilst also offering access to multidisciplinary resources. Services will support national networking of the highly specialised centres with the adult and paediatric centres working closely together to offer an integrated service and excellent transition of patients. The hubs will be required to work in a national network to support the development of national policies and protocols and to facilitate research.
The hub allocation model will be based on a regional lot breakdown as follows:
• Lot 1 - one hub for adult and paediatric cystinosis services to cover the NHS England population in the North of England

Government is required for trade purposes both within the European Union and with 3rd Countries to provide evidence of freedom from some specific diseases. Data collected through scanning surveillance contributes to this guarantee. In addition, it is recognised that early detection of threats which meet Government criteria for intervention enables characterization, assessment and appropriate action to be taken early and thereby reduce the possible impacts.

As part of the UK Government's commitment to enhance veterinary surveillance, described in its Animal Health and Welfare Strategy (AHWS) document published in 2003, the Authority extended the set of species- specific quarterly surveillance reports to include horses and donkeys. Within its delivery agency Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA), the Authority does not routinely obtain diagnostic expertise and data on equine disease in the field.

In contrast to livestock, much of the equine expertise sits outside government and equidae are served by a diverse and potentially disconnected network of private and specialist equine veterinary practice based laboratories, with specialist interest in a few specific endemic diseases based within particular research groups at universities or research institutes.

The Council intends to appoint a single organisation to a framework agreement for the management and evaluation of its tourist attraction for a period of up to four years. The Council anticipates awarding an initial two year management services contract in relation to the Sandcastle Waterpark at the same time as awarding the framework agreement, and it may elect to extend this contract for a further two years or award a long term management contract (up to twenty years extendable in five yearly increments) to the framework holder. The scope of the procurement is intended to cover additional attractions within the Council's area (including without limitation tourist attractions, recreational facilities and cultural venues) and the Council may award interim or long term management services for such venues to the selected operator throughout the term of the framework agreement.  The framework agreement is not however awarded on an exclusive basis and the Council reserves the right to award contracts for similar services outside of the framework.

The Council is conducting a single stage procedure which will evaluate price and quality of submissions received. In order to suit the Council's wider requirements the process will include the option to negotiate should it be required. The option to negotiate may be waived should it be possible for a preferred bidder to be appointed following receipt of proposals.

1.	Support the Framework for Improving ASEAN Infrastructure Productivity through exchanging knowledge on upstream infrastructure management. Share best practise on developing and implementing robust, merit-based frameworks for project screening, planning and appraisal; including assessing value for money, commercial viability, financial affordability and operational deliverability.
2.	Share lessons learned on implementing sustainability in practice, including preserving ecological value of the site and optimising existing infrastructure projects and assets.
3.	Support the Framework for Improving ASEAN Infrastructure Productivity through exchanging knowledge and best practise on attracting private sector investment. Strengthen capacity on public investment management and procurement. 

The curriculum, designed by the Authority, is as follows:
	Theme 1: Towards Net Zero: Impact on Urbanism & Infrastructure 
	Theme 2: Sustainable Systems to Delivery Better Built Environment
	Theme 3: Enablers to 'Build Back Better'	
	Theme 4: Project Delivery Frameworks
	Theme 5: Sustainable Funding & Financing
	Theme 6: Towards Net Zero Contracts & Procurement
	Theme 7: Leveraging Support & Collaborations Towards a Net Zero World

The course will involve participants from all ten AMS. The content for the course has been developed through discussions with ASEAN Secretariat by experts from various organisations. The course will be delivered virtually

The Authority is looking to procure an online portal through which the developed course will be managed.
