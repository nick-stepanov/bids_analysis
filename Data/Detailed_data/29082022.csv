NNC-LGBC-BR-2022,Contract,"North Northamptonshire Council",Awarded,2024-04-15T13:57:34+01:00,"North Northamptonshire Council Boundary Review Software Package","North Northamptonshire Council is seeking to acquire a software solution that will facilitate a Local Government Boundary Commission (LGBC) review of its electoral arrangements.

The solution must be administered by council staff including creation & management of user permissions with associated security provisions to prevent unauthorised access.

The supplier must undertake the initial set up and import of electoral data ensuring full functionality of the software to generate accurate results.  The supplier must provide ongoing technical support throughout the duration of the contract.

The package must work with modern web browsers & enable consultees to comment & propose alternative solutions and import proposals of their own for review and feedback.

The package must also enable:

Configuration of electoral areas on accurate maps with Ward, Parish, Polling District & polling stations displayed. It must enable the identification of streets & properties and number of electors at street and property level.

Mapping data to be displayed including current ward, parish and polling district boundaries, with functionality to move boundaries to amend, merge and create new electoral areas to generate multiple alternative proposals reflecting the required elector/councillor ratio and show the variation from the +/- 10% threshold.

Functionality to edit or rename electoral areas and change the number of councillors for individual areas with the associated updates to elector/councillor ratios. Calculations within the software must accurately take account of forecast electorates, future housing developments and elector/councillor ratios both present and forecast and the flexibility to re-configure areas to reflect forecasting methodology and other LGBC criteria.

The generation and export of detailed proposal reports for different scenarios which include mapping images and configuration data. It must be possible for proposals to be published and viewed by external stakeholders as part of the consultation process. The package must also support the submission of the selected proposal(s) to the LGBC.

The solution must also have the functionality to seamlessly integrate the final proposal into the Council's Electoral Management Software system (currently Xpress) to support updating the electoral register with the revised boundaries and ward names with associated quality assurance checks ensuring all data has been accurately imported and identifying any anomalies that may require attention.

Through the programme, if funding is secured, link workers within GP practices and health and wellbeing hubs will connect with local community groups and services to provide safe, supportive, off-road walking and cycling activities, for example in parks.\r
PCC transport and public health teams are looking to work with partners across Plymouth to put together a proposal that will aim to get more people walking and cycling - and enjoying the health and wellbeing benefits they bring.\r
If successful, PCC will receive funding for a three-year pilot programme that will help more people access support such as adult cycle training, led rides, led walks and complementary programmes such as bike maintenance courses and workshops.\r
The feasibility study must be submitted to the DfT by 30/04/22. The DfT will award project delivery funding based on the quality of the feasibility study. The project delivery period is for the period June 2022 - April 2025.\r
\r
To support the development of a high quality feasibility study, and thereby secure project delivery funding, PCC are seeking partners to assist in the development of the study and subsequently deliver the programmes therein, should project delivery funding be secured.\r
\r
This procurement seeks to secure a partner for the development, and subsequent delivery, of an annual community based active travel challenge as part of a programme concerning the social prescription of walking and cycling.\r
\r
The feasibility study will be led by the PCC Sustainable Transport Team. The Sustainable Transport Team will also lead the project delivery phase, should the Council secure funding for the pilot programme.\r

MID IR based instruments such as the Aeris MIRA ULTRA have orders of magnitude greater sensitivity for N2O than  alternative  technologies utilised  by  all  competing  manufacturers.

•Field  portability:  The  analyser  must  be  weather  resistant,  capable  of operating  in  humid  environments  (>90%  humidity)  and  weigh  no  more than 6 kg as analyzers will be routinely carried to and operated around remote  field  sites. 

•12  hr+  run  time:  No  alternative  analyser  can  satisfy  the  low  power requirement  and  thus  long  run  time  required.  The  Aeris  MIRA  Ultra  has  the  added  advantage  that  any  portable external battery can be used to power the instrument allowing for long run times (up to 24 hours using commercially available portable battery banks) without the need for additional, expensive proprietary batteries.

•Lead time: This purchase is funded by a UKCEH capital award and must be  receipted  before  the  end  of  2022.",,"LA1 4AP",,"38434000 ","Dewan Ferreira",dewfer@ceh.ac.uk,"Maclean Buliding","Benson Lane",Wallingford,"OX10 8BB","United Kingdom",01491833800,www.ceh.ac.uk,,,,24/08/2022,14/11/2023,23/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,73968.75,,23/08/2022,73968.75,"[Aeris Technologies, Inc.|26252 Eden Landing Road

They will work alongside the certified B company 3keel, Eftec and Exeter University to identify market opportunities and demand for Nature Based Solutions based on these existing outputs. These findings will be disseminated to 20 tenants from the estate to ascertain, in conjunction with advisers from Devon Wildlife Trust and Westcountry Rivers Trust, which options they think are most appropriate for their lands. These outputs will then be used to attempt to transact with private investors in nature based solutions. Clinton Devon Estates will provide a real-life case study of the opportunities and constraints of transacting on ecosystem service benefits related to Environmental Land Management and translating these into commercial opportunities for the tenant farmers of Clinton Devon Estates.

Output: Survey report, outputs from 3 x farmer workshops, market opportunity analysis report, natural capital demand report and a final report detailing all of the findings.

Geographic Coverage: Clinton Devon Estates is located in South West England close to the town of Budleigh Salterton

Policy Priorities: The proposal will contribute to scheme development in the following areas:

Pyts / IDM 	How can a blended finance approach be applied to both individual and collaborative group LNR agreements?
		What industry standards and farm level metrics used by private schemes should LNR consider to support alignment with private market best practice
		How can farmers and land managers stack public and private finance alongside the delivery of SFI and LNR?
		How to blend public and private finance in funding projects
		What barriers, from local to landscape scale, are present with the blended finance approach?
		What mechanisms are most effective for facilitating a blended finance approach across all three schemes? 
		How can a blended finance approach be used to drive delivery of multiple environmental outcomes?

There are a number of reasons why a new procurement process has not been possible until now. NHS England is committed to procuring the future provision and requires adequate time to do so. The new NHS Federated Data Platform is a large and complex project which we expect will deliver a transformed service when compared to the current service. A change of contractor at this stage would cause significant inconvenience and have substantial duplication of cost implications as in order to compliantly replace the contractor now would require two concurrent procurement processes to be run for the same service.

"IT-333-3413-PU-23-0068 - AWARD",Contract,"Office for National Statistics",Awarded,2022-11-23T17:56:22Z,"Online Time Use Survey (OTUS)- Wave 5  - AWARD","The OTUS (Online Time Use Survey) has been designed in response to decades of research and high-profile international reviews assessing the limitations of economic statistics in measuring a country's economic growth. For example, the report by Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi (2009) and the Independent Review of Economic Statistics in the UK (Bean, 2016) suggested shifting measurement systems away from economic production (for example, GDP) and towards measuring people's wellbeing instead.   
      
      The OTUS was proposed as a preferred means of measuring productivity. Not only did it reframe productivity away from traditional economic production values, but it also had the potential to measure a range of unpaid work, unlike GDP. This included everything from looking after children and doing household chores to using digital platforms to organise holidays (as opposed to using travel agents).   
      
      -To test if it is possible to measure time-use online in a representative and cost-effective manner.  
      
      -To track the real-time changes occurring in an unprecedented period of behavioural change due to COVID 
      
      -To understand the extent of unpaid work in the economy and its distribution between demographics (for example, the gender gap).   
      
      -To gauge whether time-use could be useful for more complete measures of paid work by incorporating aspects of gig-economy (for example delivery or taxi services such as Deliveroo and Uber) and sharing economy (for example online markets such as Ebay and Airbnb).  
      
      -To understand the feasibility of collecting information on device use and related measures such as screen-time, as well as how digital service provision is changing people's habits and who is benefitting from them.  
      
      The OTUS consists of an online diary tool and a demographic questionnaire. The diary tool is filled out online, and respondents are asked to fill out a diary for one weekday and one weekend day. The diary tool records 79 different activities people spend time on, as well as other measurements such as their enjoyment, device use, partial location, and wider caring responsibilities. The demographic questionnaire is completed at any time alongside the diary tool, and records data about the respondents such as sex, ethnicity and age, as well as measuring people's subjective well-being, such as their happiness, life satisfaction and anxiety.  
      
      ONS is looking for a survey agency to administer at least one wave (wave 5) with the possibility of two additional waves if funding becomes available (waves 6 & 7) of the OTUS on ONS' behalf.  Wave 5 will be for the period between mid-October 2022 to early December 2022, directing a representative sample of respondents to an online website diary instrument that's currently developed and hosted by another third-party provider.

"Replacement Skate Ramp",Contract,"Winscombe & Sandford Parish Council",Awarded,2022-09-26T13:51:51+01:00,"Replacement Skate Ramp","Located in the village of Winscombe, the War Memorial Recreation Ground provides residents and visitors with sports playing fields, adult exercise equipment, children's play areas and a skate park.

The skate park consists of a number of ramps which have been maintained, replaced and added to over a number of years. The central piece of equipment (spine ramp between the quarter pipes and flat banks) is little used and the surfaces deteriorating with age. It is this piece of equipment that now needs replacing with something more forgiving to younger/novice users. 

The users of the park have assisted with a design for the replacement ramp and the parish council is now seeking tenders from suitably qualified contractors to supply and install the ramp and remove the old play ramp along with all waste from this. Equipment supplied and installed must be in accordance with current British and European EN standards for skate parks and the contract must be completed before 31st March 2023 to comply with grant funding conditions.

DurhamWorks participation data trends suggests that there may be demand for twenty (20) 16-24 year old unemployed young people within the North Durham (Stanley, Consett and Chester - le-Street) area of County Durham who are interested in this specific employment routeway. This does not guarantee referrals from the DurhamWorks Progression Teams in these volumes and we expect successful bidders to generate a proportion of new registrations to the DurhamWorks programme. We are therefore looking for a provider that can deliver within this geographical area.

Contracts will be paid on the delivery and evidencing of pre-defined outputs and relate to starts, completions and progressions from your programme into Employment, Education or Training (EET).

The proposed contract is to be let with an option to extend for a further 2 periods of up to 5 months from the actual end date or completion of achieving satisfactory targets on the programme (whichever is sooner) (i.e. extensions can run concurrently), subject to funding, performance, achieving KPI's, need and Commissioner approval. Within the extension periods there is capacity to undertake changes to some elements of the activity delivery (i.e. venue, geographical delivery, model of delivery but not content). 

The maximum budget for this opportunity is £20,000 per 5 month contract period (£60,000 in total should all extension periods be invoked).

2.	Technical review of the prioritised permits/areas to:
a.	Screen out discharges not likely to be causing significant pollution of groundwater.
b.	Identify discharges/clusters of discharges potentially causing significant pollution and therefore requiring further investigation.
3.	Produce a final report of the project work, outcomes and recommendations to particularly include:

Team Newcastle was used previously by the Students' Union (NUSU) but in a more limited way (linked to performance sport/official sports teams) than is envisaged for future usage. It has also been less well used in recent years.

The relaunch of a new Team Newcastle brand and identity as a sub-brand of Newcastle University, is a key element of our new Sport and Wellbeing Strategy.

Improving and increasing self-	serve and digital channels is key to the delivery of this vision. Guiding 	current and future transformation in this direction should: 
 
•	improve customer experience and satisfaction levels  
•	reduce costs for both the taxpayer and HMRC 
•	improve the overall health of the tax system through reducing administration burdens and improving compliance  
•	fulfil HMRC's broader ambitions to be a leading and aspirational digitally driven UK tax administration. 

HMRC is developing a Channel Strategy, which will drive how 	customers interact with HMRC. The Strategy will set out how HMRC will 	support most customers to self-serve through an attractive digital channel 	offer as default. The Strategy will also set out support levels for customers 	who may need extra help, are digitally excluded or otherwise vulnerable, 	ensuring compliance and evidential requirements are considered.

HMRC is in the early stages of carrying out other research to help inform the 	future direction and successful implementation of the Channel Strategy. 	HMRC plan to share relevant insight, where appropriate, with the successful 	supplier from related research which we are currently conducting on 	taxpayers' digital appetite and preferences.

This builds on our joint commitment with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to ensure that institutional arrangements governing the energy system are fit for purpose for the long term.
Ofgem recently launched the review with a call for input, setting out and seeking evidence and views from stakeholders on the suitability of current and planned institutional and governance arrangements in place for delivery of energy system functions (energy system planning, real-time operation of local energy networks and market facilitation of flexible resources) and potential alternative arrangements.  To facilitate input from stakeholders on the case for change and potential reform options, Ofgem included in the call for input sample framework models for alternative arrangements. These sample models range from relatively small changes such as governance reforms within existing institutions to drive effective delivery of energy system functions, to more significant reforms including reshaping the roles of existing institutions or setting up new institutions.
Our next step is to compile perspectives and evidence on the case for change and further develop reform options through broad stakeholder engagement. Over the second half of this year, the focus will be on evaluating reform options, aiming to publicly set out conclusions by early 2023.",,,"Any region","71314300 71621000 79411000 73110000 73210000 ","Allan Weir",Allan.weir@Ofgem.gov.uk,"10 South Colonnade","Canary Wharf",London,"E14 4PU",England,"'+44 2079017000",http://www.ofgem.gov.uk,,"https://www.mytenders.co.uk/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=SEP165038 ",,29/08/2022,31/05/2023,08/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,170000,,29/08/2022,170000,"[Cepa|Queens House, , London|COMPANIES_HOUSE|11572350|No|No]",,29/08/2022,31/05/2023,"Open ",,12:00

inform recommendations around standardisation,   

increase confidence in understanding of the data, and   

mitigate the risks of extending prototypes to other LPA datasets.

The Authority has secured funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to support delivery of the Killingworth Site Sustainable Retrofit Project. This project is a combination of refurbishment and replacement of existing office accommodation, workshop, welfare and other facilities on the site ensuring it 'future proofs' depot operations. Energy efficiency and functionality are key principles, and the Project will use a wide range of energy efficient, generation and storage/distribution solutions to support a move to an electric powered operational fleet whilst reducing the site carbon footprint. This procurement opportunity relates specifically to Block F Vehicle Maintenance Workshop Refurbishment and North Tyneside Council will act as Principal Contractor for the project, therefore tenderers should note that they will be working in the capacity of Sub-Contractor. Tenderers must be aware that this is an operational building and as such works must be undertaken taking into consideration the ongoing workshop operations which will require work phasing and innovative delivery solutions to ensure disruption to the service is kept to a minimum. We expect tenderers to liaise closely with the service and out of hours and weekend working will at times be necessary. The Block F site is very restrictive for access / plant movements and therefore it is strongly recommended that Tenderers undertake a site visit, contact details to make arrangements are contained within the Preambles document in the tender pack.

Therefore SCDC is looking for a suitably qualified and experienced contractor to provide these services.  

The aim of the Warm Hub will be to provide support to those most vulnerable this winter to help mitigate the cost of living crisis.  The Hubs will offer a warm, friendly and inclusive environment with access to hot food, tea and coffee; somewhere to socialise, take part in activities and receive information on how to reduce bills, access financial support, and stay healthy and well.

The activities we will expect the successful contractor to deliver will be to:
•	Identify and train volunteers
•	Identify the suitable venues
•	Liaise with the Parish councils
•	Liaise with extensive network of contacts in the voluntary and statutory sector to identify the cohort of vulnerable people that could be referred to the hubs
•	Support the operational running of the hubs
•	Support and supervise the staff at the hubs
•	Provide day to day management of Staff
•	Carry out suitable risk assessment of venue
•	Ensure safeguarding policy and training for staff is in place
•	Collect quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the project
•	Share learning and outcomes with stakeholders

The project should be led by volunteers from within their communities with the aim of establishing a network of sustainable Warm Hubs across both East and South Cambridgeshire.

The project should be based on strong partnership working, take a place-based approach which brings together communities, health sector, community and local government organisations.

Wiltshire Council's current Real Time Passenger Information (RTPI) system has been in operation for over 15 years and has been supplied and is currently being maintained by Trapeze Group UK (TGUK). The maintenance service provided by TGUK is due to expire at the end of June 2022. The existing RTPI system architecture is dated and needs modernisation to meet the needs of its bus service providers, bus commuters and be able to meet the requirements specified in the Bus Services Act 2018 and Bus Open Data Service (BODS).

This document (referred to as Volume 2: Service Information) forms part of the Contract for a new RTPI system that will deliver greater functionality, innovation and benefits to the Council, bus operators and most importantly to those who will be using the bus services within Wiltshire. Funding for the new system has been secured from the Salisbury Transport Strategy, Section 106 and existing revenue budgets.

Volume 2: Service Information contains the requirements for the provision, installation and maintenance for Wiltshire's new RTPI system. Volume 2 is one of three volumes (listed below) that form the Contract:

• Volume 1: NEC4 Term Service Contract

• Volume 2: Service Information

• Volume 3: Price List
