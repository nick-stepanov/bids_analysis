Refuge offers safe accommodation and intensive support which is tied to that accommodation in Bracknell. Victims, including their children, must be refuge residents to access specialist emotional and practical support. The refuge accommodation should ideally be located across one or two properties (in a maximum of three properties) in a safe, secure, and confidential location to ensure that women and children staying in refuge can access peer support.  A local area risk assessment needs to take place to establish that the location is discreet and appropriate for vulnerable women and their children (e.g., careful consideration to be given to other unsuitable properties in the vicinity of the refuge such as HMOs for single men). There are currently two refuges run by Berkshire Women's Aid (BWA) operating in Bracknell. These refuges are part of a BWA lease and do not form any part of this procurement process. Any new Service Provider will have to source their own property to operate the refuge service in Bracknell.\r
The Outreach service is available to women and men aged 16+ living in Bracknell Forest, and who are suffering from, or are threatened by, domestic abuse.\r

All Directors of Public Health in England have a statutory duty to produce an annual report on the health of local communities. The topic chosen for the Birmingham Director of Public Health's Annual Report 2022/23 is around the role that digital technology can play in improving the public's health. This is a broad topic where several different aspects of the interaction between digital technology and health will be explored.
      
      The approach of this report will be to examine the issue through three topics. First, there will be an exploration of a population health management model and its utilisation to identify vulnerable population groups for interventions. Secondly, there will be an analysis of current public health interventions that are using digital technology and their effect/s. Thirdly, there will be a discussion around the impact of digital exclusion on health and wellbeing as well as how to design mitigations that reduce the impact in the future.
      
      The Annual Report will propose a set of recommendations for teams in Public Health that utilise digital technology in their interventions. These recommendations will distil the learning from this report and hope to illustrate how digital technology has been and can be used to improve the public's health. The final format of the report will be as a digitally accessible copy as well as limited physical copies.
      
      The requirement for ethnographic research in the DPH Annual Report is driven by the need to illustrate and understand citizens' voices within the work of Public Health and Birmingham City Council. In particular, the aims of the research are:
      
      o To understand the impacts of digital exclusion on health and wellbeing.
      o To identify barriers to improving health and wellbeing through digital technology.
      o To establish mitigations for said barriers in future public health activities.
      
      This contract will be for a period of 3 months commencing 18th July 2022 until 14th October 2022.

transformation workflow for judgments, built in an AWS infrastructure, taking transferred court judgments and upper tribunal decisions from TDR, transforming them to create xml for publication and delivering them to the Find Case Law service.
The next phase of work will make improvements to this initial pipeline and add a further transformation workflow to deliver records, including official-sensitive data, transferred from TDR to DRI in a format suitable for ingest into our preservation system. Our preference is the use of open-source systems. This second pipeline will build on the existing judgments pipeline but look to separate processes to create a decoupled approach. This second pipeline will be evaluated against a different approach (run by TNA staff) to enable us to determine the best long-term technical approach for a scalable, supportable service that will enable us to add new transformation workflows quickly.

ENV6005704R,Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT FOOD & RURAL AFFAIRS",Awarded,2022-12-08T15:13:03Z,"Review of ways to assess sufficiency of environmental endocrine disruptor databases for regulatory purposes","""According to Article 60 of the UK REACH legislation, authorisation of a chemical determined to be a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) as a result of environmental endocrine disruption (ED) can be granted in two ways: based on environmental emissions below an acceptable concentration or due to socio-economic need. To date, authorisations granted under EU REACH for SVHCs due to environmental ED have only been on socio-economic grounds.

A SETAC Pellston workshop on Ecotoxicological Hazard and Risk Assessment Approaches for Endocrine-Active Substances held in 2016 concluded that a predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) can be determined for ED provided that sufficient data are available, and therefore a risk assessment can be performed. To inform our future work on UK REACH authorisations, we would like a contractor to explore how ""sufficient data"" might be assessed or managed in relation to new Applications for Authorisation (AfAs) for substances concluded to be SVHC due to environmental ED. This will also be useful for restriction work.

The Environment Agency expects AfAs for nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEO) and octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEO) to be received by the UK Chemicals Agency in the future. Due to this, there is a related need to have up to date environmental ED datasets for these substances to allow the Environment Agency to assess the applications and set any conditions if the AfA is granted.

We regulate the TV and radio sectors, fixed line telecoms, mobile, postal services, plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate. 

We are independent and funded by fees paid to us by the companies we regulate. Further information can be found on our website www.ofcom.org.uk. 

In Autumn 2020, the UK Government introduced new legislation giving Ofcom powers to regulate UK-based video-sharing platforms (VSPs). From November 2020, VSPs which fall within our jurisdiction must comply with new rules around protecting children from potentially harmful content and all users from illegal content and incitement to hatred and violence. Research from this panel will feed into a series of annual VSP monitoring reports. 

In Spring 2021, the UK Government published its draft Online Safety Bill, granting Ofcom new responsibilities that will help to keep people safe when they are online. The bill is due to be introduced to Parliament in 2022. 

Ofcom invites Applicants to submit proposals for the market research service provision of an Online Research Panel. The online research panel is defined as having access to a large number of consumers, from which quantitative and/or qualitative data can be collected quickly and at relatively low cost. 

Any contract(s) awarded following the conclusion of the tender process will be for an initial duration of two years. At Ofcom's absolute discretion, the contract may be extended for up to two further periods of up to twelve months each. The maximum length of the contract is therefore four years.

The estimated contract value given is for the full duration of the contract including the maximum possible extensions.

This tenderer will utilise paid community researchers as apprentices and train them in qualitative research (i.e. semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observation) to upskill apprentices.
      
      The successful organisation will deliver this project with community researchers, who will initially observe the lead researcher conducting focus groups and then lead at least one focus group under supervision of the lead researcher over the course of the study period. They can also undertake participant observation and semi-structured interviews with focus group participants following training by the lead researcher.
      
      The provider will lead the delivery of 10 focus groups (see below) with food businesses in East Birmingham. These focus groups should aim to reach seldom heard voices and participants should be diverse in terms of age, ethnicity and cultural background, and socioeconomic demographics. 
      
      The 10 Focus groups should include representatives from: 
      o Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) 
      o Independent businesses 
      o A diverse range of culturally-specific food offers
      o Fast food and hot food takeaway shops (this should include Indian, Chinese and  pizza takeaways as a minimum as these are the three most popular takeaway providers in Birmingham, according to the 
              Birmingham Food Survey. Fish and chips,  fried chicken, and burger takeaways should also be included).
      o Food retail including local independent/franchise convenience stores, markets (if existing in location), large supermarkets, and cultural food retailers 
      
      The 10 Focus groups will explore: 
      o Barriers to provision of healthy affordable food (examining topics such as supply chain, consumer demand, decision-makers in the business, beliefs, cost of food,  perception of food etc.)
      o The food system workforce to establish where people are recruited from and what skills, knowledge, and training they have/receive. This may involve asking whether the workforce would have the skills 
              to deal with certain scenarios such as how to ensure a salad stays fresh (scenarios can be designed by the researcher). 
      o Potential gaps in skills and knowledge that can be filled.
      o Key actions that can be co-produced to support food businesses to provide healthy,  affordable food.

To further help students bridge the gap between pre-clinical and clinical training the University is looking to invest in five haptic simulators. Haptic simulators are used in a range of sectors, most notably flight simulation for training and revalidation, in dentistry they are used to provide a realistic virtual simulation offering continuous and objective feedback, validated assessment of competence and revalidation all in a high-fidelity virtual environment. One major limitation of traditional dental simulation is the ability to do things once - a single cavity preparation or single patient episode - haptic simulators allow procedure rehearsal multiple times before being carried out on a 'live' patient.

As part of our core specification, Cefas require the successful tenderer:

1.	to work with our chosen Travel Management Company (TMC) to obtain details of all planned travel and travellers. Use this information to tailor a comprehensive pre-travel, country-specific information pack providing details of relevance to the destination, and any en-route stopovers, including general travel advice, cultural/religious awareness and identification of main hazards and risks, including those of a medical and security nature. 
Risk mitigation measures will be identified, for example indicating the recommended vaccinations as well as highlighting necessary measures to address security threats, with the aim of managing associated travel risks. We would expect the successful Tenderer to draw from their own central team of experts, using local knowledge via in-country personnel as well as from established providers (e.g. FCDO) to build an information package. 

2.	to provide a downloadable App that is suitable for iOS. This App will provide access to all of the services offered but will have a simple front page that holds the critical information and contact methods for our travellers, providing unlimited support for pre-travel briefings and advice by phone and regular updates to the App and portal, with country-specific information and risk identification.

	Travellers who have planned upcoming trips should be kept up to date via email and App 	alerts which should automatically advise on changes to circumstances or perceived		risks/threats levels as appropriate. Once a journey has commenced, these alerts should 		continue to provide live updates of any new threats or changes in the locality or region for 	the duration of the trip. There should be 24/7 global assistance offered to travellers via a 		single contact point providing advice and assistance, from initial queries through to 		immediate on-the-ground support as needed to resolve difficulties encountered or 		emergency situations, providing ongoing coordination between the traveller, local authorities, 	medical centres and Cefas, managing any incidents that arise, on Cefas' behalf. The 	
expectation is that the successful tenderer will take responsibility for managing full end-to-	end incident resolution, including (but not necessarily limited to), access to 24hr 			advice whilst in-country, access to in-country health care as necessary, response to security 	incidents  and emergency repatriation. Support should include language/translation services 	as required to deal with in-country situations.

      Sandwell Metropolitan Borough ""The Council"" requires Manual Handling training to be delivered to staff located in various high-risk areas across the council.  Most staff will be based in Repairs, Fleet Services, Estate Services, Highways, Grounds Maintenance and Adult Services, therefore, the course needs to fit a wider audience as most sessions will have a mix of delegates from different areas.
      
      Approximately 600 employees require half-day Manual Handling training with a maximum of 15 delegates attending each cohort.  This figure will likely change due to business demand or higher priority projects taking precedence.  Training must be delivered in a classroom at a Sandwell MBC venue.

As set out in the Service Specification, the successful Bidder will provide daily and periodic cleaning for schools and other sites.

The current expectation is that there will be approximately 36 education establishment sites. However, the council wishes to allow for the option of up to any of a possible 20 (or such number up to that figure) additional state maintained school sites (including academies) situated within the borough to be added via a variation during the term of the contract if their governing bodies ask to be included within the council's contract.

The current estimated value is based on 36 sites over a 5 year maximum contract term (approximately £2.1 million per year without inflation) - the addition of further sites is not necessarily anticipated but if this were to occur this would substantially increase the value of contract by up to a total annual contract value of £4 million per year

"PROC-Digital Workspace",Contract,"INSPIRATION TRUST",Awarded,2022-07-15T16:37:56+01:00,"Google Workspace to M365","The purpose of this contract is to support and manage the implementation, migration and adoption of Microsoft 365 as the Trust standard productivity suite, online meeting platform and identity provider. The Trust pre-pandemic had outdated and costly on-premises storage which did not facilitate remote teaching and learning.  Schools had use of Google Apps Suite which was not fully utilised.  Staff and Pupils have at least 4 different usernames and passwords to access services. The pandemic forced all schools to shift to remote teaching and learning and as a result, staff moved files vital for remote teaching and learning into Google Drive.  Staff underwent a crash course in Google Classroom. Our cloud email and storage usage increased from 4.5TB to 32TB (875% increase) over a weekend. Cloud storage is made up of Google Docs and Email, Microsoft Office Documents, and Audio and Video files. Post pandemic we now have multiple platforms used for storing data with no visibility of the types of data they contain, this could be personal, private, or confidential information (PII). Nor do we know exactly where it is and who has access to it. Moving from multiple platforms to a single standard platform and data structure will enable the Trust to maintain control of all data by putting controls on PII whilst ensuring a consistent approach to document formats used pan-trust by having a single software platform compatible with many external organisations whilst also reducing shadow IT accessible through a single identity.
