\r
The service is intended to deliver an innovative response to tackling domestic abuse, working directly with those who use harmful or abusive behaviours in their intimate relationships. The focus will be on targeting those individuals demonstrating some level of risky behaviour within their intimate relationships and offering domestic abuse awareness raising with the aim of addressing abusive behaviour before it becomes entrenched.\r
\r
The overall aim of the service is to improve the safety, health and well-being of partners, ex-partners, children and themselves. The project is not a full longer-term behaviour change programme for high harm/high risk perpetrators. It is anticipated that individuals benefitting from the project will be first time offenders and/or those who do not yet recognise their harmful behaviours and the impact on their partners, or those not willing/able to engage in a longer-term\r
programme.\r
\r
The service contract will commence on 01 January 2023 for an initial period of 2 years with an option to extend for a further period up to a total of 12 months, taking the contract term to a maximum of 3 years. Any extension(s) will be at a sole discretion of the Council and subject to funding and overall contract performance.\r
\r
The initial maximum contract value is £50,000.00 per annum (£150,000.00 for the maximum of 3 years). This could alter through the life of the contract in light of changes in future local and central government funding.\r
\r
The procurement process will be carried out in accordance with the Council's Contract Procedure Rules (SI 2015/102) (as amended) (""The 2015 Regulations""), part4G of the Council's Constitution.

It will provide a command of the underlying species evidence, representing the first steps towards holistic species recovery within Natural England's Nature Recovery Network. It does so by centralising species information in one place in a novel and new way. This Species Evidence Base (SEB) will focus on important species listed in Environment Act targets, notably those associated with the abundance target and the extinction rate target.  

We require specialists to gather the data for Fungi that includes 125 species (Species listed in Annex 1). Evidence gathered for each species is split into five categories: Trends, Habitats, Pressures, Climate Change and Actions.  In total there will be approximately 50 fields that need addressing for each species (Provisional fields and parameters list in Annex 2) .   

For most fields, there will parameters on what can be entered- either Yes/No or multiple choice based on a range. Supplier will fill out the fields based on their current knowledge and understanding for each species. We do not expect there to be existing evidence for all the fields for all species and expect that supplier will use their expertise and experience of Fungi to provide their best estimate.

Project Aims  

1.	Investigate available data sets and prepare methodology for extracting data for the development of; 
o	a draft spatial layer identifying areas of known degraded peatland for use in this project (this will be replaced at a later date with data from NE's new Peat Map).
o	a spatial layer of past and current restoration activity for use as a baseline for reporting of future net increases in activity, i.e. Jan 1st 2023, and for incorporation into the HCSA.
2.	Apply the methodology to create a spatial layer that uses the best available data to identify
o	the current known areas of degraded peat 
o	the baseline of current peat creation/restoration activity (Note that this activity will be dependent upon data availability and any useful data sources not currently available need to be recorded).
3.	Review approaches being adopted in Scotland and Wales for mapping peat restoration and provide recommendations for consideration as part of the England Peat Restoration Register that allows for easy extraction of data for biodiversity target reporting and input into the HCSA. 
4.

      Green Flag Award winning since 2002, Oakmere Park in Potters Bar is the town's most popular park and provides a range of facilities including two children's play area's, petanque court, basketball post, outdoor fitness equipment, interactive play, tree trail, a wildflower meadow and two lakes.  The park also hosts local events including Movies in the Park, Easter Egg Hunt and Family Fun Day.
      Oakmere Park was once the grounds to Oakmere House which is now operated as a restaurant and public house and provides a welcoming retreat with pleasing views across the park.  The classic 19th century layout of the park with lakes and specimen trees is still largely intact, although the grand entrance lodges and sweeping carriage way have been removed.
      There is a deficit in provision of open space and play in Potters Bar and the Oakmere ward - Oakmere Park is an important park serving this ward (classified as an area of deprivation) and the town.
      
      This popular play area, (the only play area for this age range in this part of town) was installed in 1999 with many items of equipment now life expired providing a dated play experience.  
      
      The much needed play area improvements commenced in 2018 with the installation of an innovative and interactive football sports court which encourages physical activity and play in a fun way for multi-players and also a crusader swing which is popular with users of all ages.  In 2019 the Junior Play area was improved to create a more interesting and destination play space with an emphasis on the parks heritage whilst assisting improved access, increased usage and promoting physical activity through play.
      We have now secured £100,000 capital funding to improve the Toddler Play Area and this tender is for the enhancement of the play area in line with the following project brief and conditions of contract. 
      The timing and sequencing of these works is important to minimise disruption or non-availability of park facilities for the public and must be completed by 31 March 2023 at the latest.",,"WD6 1WA","Any region","43325000 45236210 45112723 37535200 ","Margaret Haynes (HBC)",margaret.haynes@hertsmere.gov.uk,"Elstree Way",Borehamwood,Hertfordshire,"WD6 1WA","United Kingdom","0208 207 2277",www.hertsmere.gov.uk,,,,30/01/2023,31/03/2023,02/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,0,0,17/11/2022,100000,"[Proludic Limited|The Play Hub, Bradmore Business Park, Loughborough Road, Bunny, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom, NG11 6QA|NONE||No|No]",,30/01/2023,31/03/2023,"Open ",,17:00

It will provide a command of the underlying species evidence, representing the first steps towards holistic species recovery within Natural England's Nature Recovery Network. It does so by centralising species information in one place in a novel and new way. This Species Evidence Base (SEB) will focus on important species listed in Environment Act targets, notably those associated with the abundance target and the extinction rate target.  

We require specialists to gather the data for Bryophytes that includes 168 species (Species listed in Annex 1). Evidence gathered for each species is split into five categories: Trends, Habitats, Pressures, Climate Change and Actions.  In total there will be approximately 50 fields that need addressing for each species (Provisional fields and parameters list in Annex 2) .   

For most fields, there will parameters on what can be entered- either Yes/No or multiple choice based on a range. Supplier will fill out the fields based on their current knowledge and understanding for each species. We do not expect there to be existing evidence for all the fields for all species and expect that supplier will use their expertise and experience of Bryophytes to provide their best estimate.

The Advanced Bioimaging RTP helps researchers answer their scientific questions using state-of-the-art 3D electron microscopy and light microscopy imaging equipment. Our strategy is to offer this advanced bioimaging capability and the expertise to deliver high impact results to researchers both at Warwick and beyond. The Advanced Bioimaging RTP provides the training and expertise required to operate the equipment as well as providing a service to users. Due to successful funding from BBSRC, Alert14 and more recently the founding of the Midlands Regional CryoEM Consortium (established 2017 through £4.9M funding from MRC and partner universities Warwick, Leicester, Birmingham and Nottingham), we have one high-end microscope (Jeol 2200 FEG-TEM with internal energy filter) and a state-of-the-art camera (Gatan K2 Summit Direct electron detector), a Jeol 2100plus cryo-transmission electron microscope suitable for cellular specimens, sample characterisation and user training, and access to a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope for state-of-the-art high resolution structure determination work. 
      
      In order to support characterisation of challenging samples for structural biology using cryo-electron microscopy we seek a mass photometer instrument that will enable us to measure particle size distributions in complex protein samples. 
      
      The Advanced Bioimaging RTP is service-oriented, and has users from multiple disciplines (Life sciences, chemistry, physics and engineering), therefore ease of use and reliable performance are essential.

It is important that the efficacy evaluation considers any specific agronomic conditions in terms of the crops grown, the pests that affect them, climatic conditions, typical rotations and the resistance status of any pests.  

The objective of the project is to produce a review of horticulture and arable farming in Northern Ireland (NI) and the status of associated pests. 
The review will provide sufficient information  to improve understanding of agronomic practices in NI and identify aspects that may  differ to Great Britain (GB).  Providing information on the range and acreages of crops, major or minor status of crop pests  will ensure that the relevance to NI of the regulatory data submitted to support product authorisations can be assessed.

Leeds Media Centre was last refurbished in 2001; all major installations and building components are therefore approximately 20 years old.  The building is operational and partially occupied by multiple tenants (renting on a flexible basis) but it is in need of refurbishment throughout.  Due to budget limitations and the presence of tenants, the works focus primarily on the building fabric and communal areas.  There will be minimal access required to occupied offices (for replacement windows for example). 

Headline scope of works includes: 

            Removal of existing redundant plant from the roof, recovering the roof with a tapered insulation system
            Renewal of existing rainwater goods
            Removal and replacement of existing external building envelope components including windows and doors
            Repairs to the external building envelope
            Internal layout reconfiguration
            Renewal of all sanitary fittings
            Renewal of the kitchen facilities to first and second floors
            Replacing the existing heating system
            Replacing the existing ventilation system
            Replacing the existing passenger lift
            Alterations to existing building services installations including installation of some new ducted mechanical ventilation
            Works required under the BREEAM refurbishment category including the provision for renewable energy solutions.

The completed upgrades must enable the building to achieve an EPC score of B. 

Although we will be using a Design and Build Contract, the design and specifications have been worked up to an advanced level (reasonably beyond RIBA stage 3) and the Contractor will also have the ability to novate any members of the design team (Architects, Mechanical and Electrical designers, EPC / BREEAM assessor).  

The project is part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Leeds City Council and Unity Enterprise.  The works must be completed by 30th June 2023 as this is the funding backstop date.

DurhamWorks participation data trends suggests that there may be demand for 16-24 year old unemployed young people within the Central Durham, South Durham and East Durham areas of County Durham who are interested in this specific employment routeway. 

This does not guarantee referrals from the DurhamWorks Progression Teams in these volumes and we expect successful bidders to generate a proportion of new registrations to the DurhamWorks programme. We are looking for a maximum of two providers that can deliver service requirements as per demand from our participants. 

Contracts will be paid on the delivery and evidencing of pre-defined outputs and relate to starts, completions and progressions from your programme into Employment, Education or Training (EET).

The proposed contract is to be let with an option to extend for a further 1 period of up to 5 months from the actual end date or completion of achieving satisfactory targets on the programme (whichever is sooner) (i.e. extensions can run concurrently), subject to funding, performance, achieving KPI's, need and Commissioner approval. Within the extension periods there is capacity to undertake changes to some elements of the activity delivery (i.e. venue, geographical delivery, model of delivery but not content). 

The maximum budget for this opportunity is £50,000 per 5 month contract period (£100,000 in total should the extension period be invoked).

Bids received must be between a minimum of 15participants and up to a maximum of 25 participants.

The project is funded by the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative, part of the investment priority 1.3: Sustainable Integration of Young People into the Labour Market.

Overview
Hartford Parish Council is a public body and as such is required to comply with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (""the Regulations"") when it intends to procure or award a public supply contract, public service contract or public works contract, as defined by The Regulations, which is valued at £25,000 or more. The Regulations require councils to use the Contracts Finder website to advertise contract opportunities, set out the procedures to be followed in awarding new contracts and to publicise the award of new contracts.
The Council's Standing Orders and Financial Regulations also requires open advertising of the opportunity via appropriate media.
Existing Pavilion
The existing building was built in 1984 and consists of 3 changing rooms (home and away teams and the referee), 2 large shower rooms, toilets and a very small kitchen.  It is a single breeze block construction, single glazed and has no insulation.  The building is showing its age and is in a poor condition.  Additional metal grills have been fitted to the doors and windows, for security purposes, giving an abandoned and neglected appearance.

An asbestos survey was carried out in January 2022 and didn't find any in the building although the original roof tiles are 'Eternit' asbestos cement tiles - original drawings are available on request.
Refurbishment

The market town councils of Dursley, Nailsworth, Stonehouse, Stroud, and Wotton-under-Edge want to promote tourism in each of the towns and their surrounding areas, all of which are located within Stroud District. To achieve this the market towns wish to procure consultants to create a range of content suitable for the visitor and tourism markets for each town. In conjunction with this, the local district council is re-engaging with tourism after a gap of some years and has appointed a new Tourism Officer. The Town Councils welcome the creation of this post and want to complement it by improving the tourism offer for each of their towns. Work should commence in time to capture the autumn/Christmas holiday markets.  

Aim
The aim is to promote the individuality and unique offer of each market town. This should also recognise opportunities for thematic experiential offers across all the towns within the district, and their immediate surroundings. Visitors may be unaware of the range of things to see, do and experience, or the choice of facilities available. These visitors could be day or overnight/weekend visitors. The aim is to provide various forms of content and visitor information that emphasizes the distinctiveness of each town. Whilst distinct to each town, content should be engaging, similar in terms of tone, and be complementary across the towns within the district.",,,"South West","75125000 92312211 ","Helen Bojaniwska",helen.bojaniwska@stroudtown.gov.uk,"Thanet House,58 London Road",,STROUD,GL52AD,England,"01453 762817",,"FINAL Stroud Mkt Towns Tourism Brief (V4) 1.8.22.pdf Form of tender CONTRACT STC2022-3.docx Questions received as at 26Aug22.docx Questions received as at 1.9.22.pdf ",,,31/10/2022,31/12/2022,12/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,25000,,14/11/2022,24950,"[Tourism Angles|Private address|NONE_SOLE_TRADER||Yes|No]",,14/11/2022,31/03/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire is seeking innovative solutions in response to a Safer Streets 4 programme running across Cheshire in the Local Authorities of Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire East and Halton.

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire is hoping to attract a nationally recognised provider working to prevent Violence Against Women and Girls to deliver an educational bystander programme in schools across Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester and Halton. 

There are two elements to this programme. Firstly the development of bespoke and age appropriate bystander educational inputs to schools in the 3 local authority areas.  Secondly the development of bespoke bystander training to assist and support those individuals working in and around the Night Time Economy of the 3 local authority areas.   Both aspects of training will be focused on changing attitudes and beliefs, promoting awareness and practical things that can be undertaken to keep safe. A single supplier will be selected through this process to deliver both elements. There are significant time pressures around the delivery of these projects which is linked to the funding that are beyond our control as such it is anticipated that any bidders will have products in existence that are easily adapted for this work or such levels of experience that allows those products to be developed very quickly. Much of the work needs to be ready for a December 2022 implementation and roll out completed by September 2023. 

The contract will have the facility to be extended up to 31st March 2026 to cover additional educational arenas, subject to funding availability.

Its purpose is to collect evidence on the rates of (non-criminal) legal problems experienced by different groups of people and detailed data on the different resolution strategies people use and the outcomes that result. The survey will provide detailed up-to-date information that will inform the overarching evaluation of court reform and will also provide valuable evidence to support policy development across the Access to Justice directorate. Additionally, it will include a suite of questions on public attitudes to the use of digital services and video hearings in the courts and tribunals system. 

The benefits of the survey include: providing data that can be used to assess the extent to which people are able and willing to access the formal legal system to resolve their legal problems and whether this varies by demographic characteristics; the sources of advice and support people use when trying to resolve legal problems; and the outcomes of legal problems and their consequences, and whether these vary by resolution strategy used and demographic characteristics.",,,"Any region","73110000 ",,MoJProcurementProfessionalServices@Justice.gov.uk,"10 South Colonnade",,London,"E14 4PU",England,,,"REDACTED con_21266_DPS-Schedule-6-Order-Form-Template-v1.0_FINAL 1111 (002).pdf ",,,20/09/2022,19/03/2024,19/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,565700,,17/11/2022,565700,"[Ipsos (Market Research) Ltd|3 Thomas More Square, London.

Justification for single Tender Action:
Facilitation is an art, bringing together the style of a facilitator with the people they work with and the situations, topics, challenges the teams or individuals want or need to address. Finding good facilitators who can work with teams across HE is not easy and relies on facilitators having a variety of tools, approaches and methods, a flexibility of style and the ability to understand HE and its people so they can have rapport and can challenge the individuals and teams. Only working with a few teams in HE can let us know that a facilitator can be used across HE and with what kind of teams.
Lara Gilkes from Human Synergy has worked with a few teams so far and has gained their trust. One team has requested a follow up team event as well as coaching a few team members. We anticipate using her over the next financial year with a few different teams across HE. The teams will pay Human Synergy from their individual budgets.
Her daily rate is £1200 for design, £1400 for delivery, £3000 for a coaching programme and in line with other facilitators and coaches we use.

This usually takes between 8-12 weeks.

Due to the number of temporary properties available we foresee a maximum of two moves out and two moves back in any given week. However, this amount can increase/decrease throughout the contract.

CYC will endeavour to programme moves a month in advance, however, due to the nature of these works they are subject to changes and a final schedule may not be provided until one week before removals are to be undertaken.  We require a supplier to accommodate this flexibility. There may also be occasions, unrelated to this programme of work, when CYC require a tenant's possessions to be moved/stored due to an unforeseen circumstance making their property uninhabitable.

All properties are within the City of York boundary and wherever possible the temporary accommodation is in a similar location to the permanent property. 

In general terms we require the following for each property (which should be accounted for when completing the pricing schedule): - Provision of sufficient boxes and packing materials to the tenant 4 weeks prior to removal date  Consult the Open ITT Part 2 - Specification document for full details of what is required.

CYC require the successful Supplier to adhere to the British Association of Removers, Code of Practice. Suppliers must evidence they have this imbedded in with their organisation; Please see Appendix D, Code of Practice. Similar associated practices are accepted, please provide information on this.

The course will be modular and entirely practical in its approach.
