      We are interested in seeing options for a refresh of the current Foster Birmingham logo but are constricted by budget from completing a full rebranding exercise, therefore consideration would be taken when scoring applications that do not address this desirable requirement. 
      
      This contract will be for a period of 2 years commencing from the date of signing with an option to extend for a further 12 months.  
      
      The Council will be using its free to use e-tendering system (in-tend) for the administration of this procurement process and potential suppliers must register with the system to be able to express an interest.

Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
â¢	safer care for patients 
â¢	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
â¢	access to the full patient record at the point of care
â¢	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

(EPS) and a new Multi-Static Active (MSA) Receiver Sonobuoy (MSARS) optimised 
for use with the G-ALFEA sonobuoy. The main output of this task will be preliminary 
designs for the EPS and MSARS that would allow prototypes of the two sonobuoy 
types to be built with minimal technical risk in potential follow-on work.
Background
The Miniaturised Sonobuoy Phase 4 (SBM4) task resulted in a range of options being 
presented designed to meet the requirements for a G-size size sonobuoy capable of 
passive sensing and acting as a receiver in a Multi-Static Active (MSA) field. These 
options included sonobuoys that would meet both passive sensing and MSA receiver 
requirements in a single package and sonobuoy types that are specialised for either 
passive sensing or for use as a MSA receiver. A stakeholder workshop was held in which 
it was concluded that the best options to be taken forward are:
1. a specialised passive sensing sonobuoy that enhances the existing HIDAR 
sonobuoy with an additional wideband transducer, and
2. a specialised MSA receiver sonobuoy based on the BARRA sonobuoy but

"LSB - IT Managed Service Contract",Contract,"LEGAL SERVICES BOARD",Awarded,2022-05-06T15:34:52+01:00,"IT Managed Service Contract","The Legal Services Board (LSB) is looking to appoint a suitably qualified provider of IT managed services. As a very small organisation, we do not have an in-house IT capability. We are looking for a supplier who can work in partnership with LSB to deliver the IT Managed Services to a high standard. Our aim is to appoint a supplier to provide an IT managed service to LSB commencing between 1 March 2022 and 31 May 2022 to allow parallel running with the existing supplier to facilitate an appropriate handover.
The Legal Services Board is the independent body responsible for overseeing the regulation of lawyers in England and Wales. In all our work, we seek to promote the eight regulatory objectives set out in the Legal Services Act 2007. We share our regulatory objectives with the 'approved regulators' of the legal profession, each of which have direct responsibility for the day-to-day regulation of the different types of lawyers.
As at 30 September 2021 we consist of 35 executive staff members (29 full-time and 6 part-time) and 9 non-executive directors that work part-time. We also provide IT licences and IT support to our Consumer Panel members (8 licences as at 30 September 2021) Our premises is currently located in central London with staff allowed to work flexibly anywhere geographically.
We work in an agile way and our approach is to enable our colleagues to work in any location at any time and LSB plans for this to continue in the future. We monitor changes in our operating environment, reviewing our objectives and, if necessary, adapting our approach. LSB users typically work between the hours of 7am and 7pm, Mondays to Fridays Some work takes place outside these hours and on weekends but on a limited scale.
There is a budget ceiling of Â£32,500 for the IT managed service per annum excluding VAT. This would exclude the cost of Microsoft office licences and cloud services which we would expect to be passed on at cost. Bids above this may still be considered with the score for Price adjusted to reflect this.
A tender is required which should include method statements, but not be limited to:
â¢ A description of how you would work with us.
â¢ A description of how you will meet the service specification requirements listed in the attached ITT.
â¢ A description of your recommended support package and what this 
includes and suggested SLAs (see Appendix Five)
â¢ A fully costed proposal including, but not limited to, remote support, hourly rates, discounts for block time agreements and costs for attending any site listed above. Where possible this should be broken down into annual costs including any set up fees.
â¢ Privacy policy documentation around accessing any corporate data held on our servers, PCs or mobile devices.
All tender submissions should be submitted by 12 noon on 15 November 2021 to tenders@legalservicesboard.org.uk. Submissions submitted to other addresses or beyond this time will not be accepted.

There are current arrangements where some RSLs do contribute and make payments to DCC.  DCC HIA carries out the works to all tenures and in the case of Believe Housing it has been paying for its own adaptations as part of the stock transfer agreement up to a specific level of spend (which has now been reached)

Believe Housing, as part of the stock transfer agreement has funded its own adaptations 100% since transfer but as from 1st April 2022 that responsibility will come back to DCC. 
The proposal is that Believe would make a contribution of 50% towards the adaptations costs as a goodwill gesture which means DCC would save 50% of the costs of works.  As part of the proposal Believe are requesting use of their own contractors to continue to deliver the adaptations to its stock with its own staff and contractors, in part for continuity of service, with DCC making the 50% contribution to them from our DFG allocation.

There is significant benefit to the Council in proceeding with a Single Supplier Negotiation with Believe Housing.  The council would save time and resources managing adaptations for Believe Housing tenants, and also that DCC expected circa Â£1m spend in the forward year, for Believe Housing adaptations, would be reduced to circa Â£500k.",,,England,"75123000 ","Lesley Champion",lesley.champion@durham.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Durham,"DH1 5UJ",England,"'+44 3000266110",http://www.durham.gov.uk,,,,17/04/2022,31/03/2023,11/03/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,500000,500000,28/03/2022,500000,"[Believe Housing|Spectrum Business Park

In 2015/16 the organisation led a 12-month process to develop a Lancashire-wide partnership to provide specialist employability and skills support to young people aged 15-24 who are unemployed or economically inactive including those not in employment, education or training 'NEET' or at risk of becoming NEET. This project is known as Invest in Youth and is part of the Building Better Opportunities programme.

Building Better Opportunities (BBO) is a national programme funded by The National Lottery Community Fund (NLCF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) to invest in local projects tackling the root causes of poverty, promoting social inclusion and driving local jobs and growth.

The Invest in Youth project consists of approximately 11 diverse delivery partners from the voluntary, community, and social enterprise sectors, coming together to deliver specialist support for key groups across Lancashire. Selnet is the lead partner and does not undertake any delivery or direct support to participants. Invest in Youth has been operational since August 2016 and has recently received additional investment extending project delivery to the end of 2022.

Selnet is looking to select a suitably qualified and experienced organisation to provide employability skills support to Invest in Youth participants from within Lancashire. Preferred bidder status will be awarded to the organisation offering the most economically advantageous tender (in accordance with the evaluation criteria, scoring and weightings as set out in this document). The maximum budget available to the successful provider will be Â£75,000 and the successful provider must be able to meet the targets detailed above.

Proposals are sought from organisations that can demonstrate competence in engaging with and delivering relevant support to young people with multiple and complex barriers into employment, training or education.

      Our vision for Sandwell 2030 is that it will be a place that is thriving, optimistic and has a resilient community. The Sandwell School Health Nursing Programme and the Sandwell Paediatric Vision Screening Service will make an important contribution towards; 
      
      o Aspiration 2; Sandwell is a place where we live healthy lives and live them for longer, and where those of us who are vulnerable feel respected and cared for.
      
      o Aspiration 4; Our children benefit from the best start in life and a high-quality education throughout their school careers with outstanding support from their teachers and families.
      
      The best possible health underpins a child's or young person's ability to fulfil their potential as they grow up. Research shows that good health and emotional wellbeing are associated with improved attendance and attainment at school, which in turn lead to improved employment opportunities. In addition, children who thrive at school are better placed to act on information about how to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
      
      In 2009, the Department for Health set out an evidence-based programme of best practice; the Healthy Child Programme, with the ambition of making everywhere as good as the best by developing improvements in health and wellbeing for children and young people. The Healthy Child Programme has recently been modernised to reflect societal changes and the impact of COVID-19 (Public Health England, 2021) and the provision of universal vision screening is identified within the Healthy Child Programme as crucial to enabling early diagnosis and treatment of vision problems.

Quite simply, commerciality and social value could co-exist and create an innovative and purposeful new model. We are the UK's only pro-social body providing agency services to construction frameworks with a proven track record of supporting deprived communities by investing our profits into community prevention and intervention initiatives. Pro-social businesses are self-sustainable social organisations that exist to provide social benefits to the communities around them.The framework has been designed taking into consideration the construction playbook to ensure the framework is fit for purpose for its  public-sector users. Users  of SAFE's current framework, which will shortly come to term, include NHS Foundation Trusts https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-provider-directory/#l, Clinical Commissioning Groups, Educational Institutions, Providers of Social Housing, Local Authorities, Charities and 3rd Sector Groups and Community Led Housing Organisations across the North West of England and North Wales.Public-sector bodies able to access the framework will include: Local Authorities, Universities, Schools, Academies, Colleges, Social Housing Providers, Community Land Trusts or other Community Led Housing Organisations, Emergency Services, Health & Social Care providers, NHS bodies, Clinical Commissioning groups, Government Departments, Museum and Arts, Charities & 3rd Sector Organisations and Public Body subsidiary companies.The framework will operate across North West of England (Merseyside, Cheshire, Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester), North Wales (Isle of Anglesey, Conway, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Wrexham), Yorkshire and the Humber (East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, North Lincolnshire, North East Lincolnshire).The framework will consist of 17 Groups with each group having varying values of work/services (value bands).

"GLD014 2021",Contract,"Government Legal Department",Awarded,2022-03-04T13:05:07Z,"GLD014 2021 GLAS Panel - Pensions Related Legal Services","Following the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, the Authority's workload has increased substantially, and will continue to increase. This increase in demand cannot be fully met from the Authority's own resources.

The Authority therefore seeks the assistance of one or more teams of lawyers, with particular experience and expertise in the area of pensions law and public law, to work with the Authority's lawyers and their departmental clients on an instruction-by-instruction basis in order to increase legal resources available to respond to 'business as usual' potentially also EU-exit related work.

The Supplier may be asked to co-work on a matter with a GLD lawyer, or may be the principal Supplier of legal support; the degree of GLD involvement will be determined by the Authority and [the Client Department] on an instruction-by-instruction basis.

The Supplier will work together with the Authority, its Client Departments and where appropriate external stakeholders, and will be required to support the Authority through:

Providing risk-based legal advice, applying the GLD risk framework (embedded below), in concise plain English, in a form agreed with the Authority and the instructing lawyer at the outset of the supplier's involvement on each instruction. It is expected that these matters will be largely, but not exclusively, related to pensions law and related issues of public law. Such advice is to be provided in the most cost effective fashion and in a timeframe as determined by the instructing lawyer, the Client Department and/or the Authority.
 
The Supplier will work as part of a wider team of lawyers, policy experts and officials, within the Client Department for each individual instruction and with stakeholders, where necessary. The Supplier will consult them as appropriate and refer issues requiring specialist public law expertise to their instructing lawyer. Where required, team working will include effectively working as in-house counsel on a long-term project, requiring the ability to work with individuals of varying seniority and with varying degrees of subject-matter expertise.

This increase in demand cannot be fully met from the Authority's own resources.

The Authority therefore seeks the assistance of one or more teams of lawyers, with particular experience and expertise in the area of pensions law and public law, to work with the Authority's lawyers and their departmental clients on an instruction-by-instruction basis in order to increase legal resources available to respond to 'business as usual' potentially also EU-exit related work.

The Supplier may be asked to co-work on a matter with a GLD lawyer, or may be the principal Supplier of legal support; the degree of GLD involvement will be determined by the Authority and [the Client Department] on an instruction-by-instruction basis.

The Supplier will work together with the Authority, its Client Departments and where appropriate external stakeholders, and will be required to support the Authority through:

Providing risk-based legal advice, applying the GLD risk framework (embedded below), in concise plain English, in a form agreed with the Authority and the instructing lawyer at the outset of the supplier's involvement on each instruction. It is expected that these matters will be largely, but not exclusively, related to pensions law and related issues of public law. Such advice is to be provided in the most cost effective fashion and in a timeframe as determined by the instructing lawyer, the Client Department and/or the Authority.
 
The Supplier will work as part of a wider team of lawyers, policy experts and officials, within the Client Department for each individual instruction and with stakeholders, where necessary. The Supplier will consult them as appropriate and refer issues requiring specialist public law expertise to their instructing lawyer. Where required, team working will include effectively working as in-house counsel on a long-term project, requiring the ability to work with individuals of varying seniority and with varying degrees of subject-matter expertise.
