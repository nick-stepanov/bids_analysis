Construction works started in 2011 and the first residents moved in during the following year. In
February 2022, the town had grown to approximately 6,500 residents occupying around 2,600 properties. The current Local Plan which covers the period until 2031 makes provision for the delivery of circa 8,000 homes housing in the region of 25,000 residents - so Cranbrook will be at least a medium-sized town and probably the second-biggest settlement in East Devon.

As part of the development, multi-use sports pitches were delivered in 2019 which are well-used, predominantly by youth teams. Cranbrook Town Council manages the sports pitches and is now looking to commission the construction of a multi-use games area (MUGA) at the site.

The DWP stipulate how each Unitary must distribute the funds within a range of household categories i.e., families with children, pensioners and households evidencing severe financial hardship.

The main purpose of the EOI is to identify organisations that are capable of managing the 3rd category 'households evidencing financial hardship'.

In order to meet the needs of households who are in severe financial hardship, especially regarding food and energy costs, we are looking for organisations who can operate locally for NNC in distributing HSF funds to households who evidence severe financial hardship. These funds will be issued mainly in the form of supermarket vouchers. The distribution will be in the first instance to smaller and bespoke voluntary and charitable organisations and thereafter directly to residents who meet the HSF criteria.

We would like to invite Expressions of Interest for highly governed organisation for a period of 3 months to evidence capability, capacity and experience in funds distribution to the voluntary sector. This will require a management layer that is experienced in managing downstream suppliers (i.e., local voluntary organisations).

Please note this is a request for formal Expression of Interest (EOI). This document does not form any part of an invitation to tender but may lead to a procurement process. Any supplier responding to this Expression of Interest is doing so to help develop a procurement process that is accessible to the market.

The overall aim of the Derby Safe Haven is to establish a safe, non-clinical environment whereby people with urgent mental health needs - who would otherwise require or seek support from Accident and Emergency secondary or acute mental health services - can receive support and de-escalation.

The service was to be situated in Derby in a fixed and accessible location that maximises access across not only within Derby City, but for people across the rest of the Derbyshire footprint also.

The service contract is for 2 years with the option to extend for a further 12 months. It is recognised that the service and the system will need to learn and adapt to the dynamic needs of the population throughout the duration of the service, and collaborative working between provider and commissioners will be critical to success. 

Please note there was a financial threshold associated with this procurement. Any bids received exceeding £200,000 per annum over the term of the contract were to be excluded from evaluation and disqualified from the process.

This research will deliver comparative life cycle assessment for a basket of representative key commodities consumed in the UK.  Domestic versus overseas production will be contrasted, as will in and out of season production where applicable.  Impact 'hotspots' in UK production will be identified.  The potential for emerging technology to reduce impacts will be appraised and the wider impacts of at scale adoption of those technologies identified. The findings will inform interventions to enable sustainable productivity growth in domestic commodity production.  
Background
Defra aims to make our air purer, water cleaner, land greener and food more sustainable. Defra's mission is to restore and enhance the environment for the next generation, and to leave the environment in a better state. The food and drink industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK giving rise to a large environmental impact. The food chain (including agriculture) accounts for approximately 19% of the UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ,  with just over half  being from primary production.  For Defra to meet obligations under the Climate Change Act  (2008) and 25-Year Environment Plan (25YEP) targets whilst delivering under the UK Clean Growth Strategy, it is necessary to understand where and how the food system can become more productive and where environmental impacts and land-use for food production can be reduced, whilst taking account of socio-economic externalities and wider societal needs.  This is also relevant for Defra's White Paper response to the recommendations of an independent review of the food system expected in 2021. Increased global trade in food and an increase in year-round food production has led to increased import to the UK of some food products and greater out of season domestic production of others.  Further changes in the provenance of commodities imported into the UK may occur following the UK's withdrawal from the EU.",,"SW1P 3JR","Any region","03000000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"Nobel House, 17 Smith Square",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,http://defra.bravosolutions.co.uk,"Ecm 65226 -Greenwich - Research Terms and Conditions LCA Food Basket Fnal_Redacted.pdf ",,,25/07/2022,24/01/2024,07/10/2021,YES,tender_283579/991001,Yes,Yes,No,Services,543314,,25/07/2022,543314,"[University of Greenwich|Old Royal Naval College, Park Row, Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS|COMPANIES_HOUSE|986729|No|No]",,25/07/2022,24/01/2024,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

Students are required to meet relevant Enabling Objectives (EOs) and Training Objectives (TOs) contained in the Training Performance Statements within a formal training environment. Being exposed to free fall in a controlled environment, prior to live practical assessments, allows a student to experience the realism of the feeling of airflow around the body, and how movements of body parts can affect this. A VWT has an immeasurable capacity of transferable skills to live parachute descents and allows enhanced training to take place in a fraction of the time when compared; 2 minutes in a VWT equates to 2 free fall parachute descents which would take approximately 2 hours to complete. Parachutists with experience of free fall prior to their first live assessment will have a sound foundation and basic skill set that will allow them to focus on additional EOs and TOs which must be achieved in what is now a safety critical environment. Due to the EOs and TOs contained in the above mentioned AS there is a requirement for PJIs to undertake training to conduct this coaching as detailed in the VWTI (Vertical Wind Tunnel Instructor) Assessment Strategy.

Green Bus Routes form a key part of how the region plans to 'Build Back Better' and is a cornerstone of the Metro Mayors key election pledges around seeking to develop a London style transport network. Through our soon to be published Bus Service Improvement Plan and forthcoming City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement we are confident that we have the framework and funding to deliver on these high-quality commitments.
The programme of improvement measures on these key Green Bus Routes are aimed at reducing journey times and transforming the punctuality and reliability of bus journeys along several priority bus corridors within the Liverpool City Region. In addition to reducing journey times and increasing bus reliability, the Combined Authority and its partners are clear that these improvements must also have a positive impact on improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions. They must also enhance local communities through maximising social value and improving the public realm. The increased investment and focus on Active Travel are also now a key consideration for the project, and opportunities for co-designing walking and cycling improvements, alongside measures to improve bus services, are strongly encouraged.
Since August 2019 work has been underway to develop Route Improvement Plans for three key corridors (A57, A562 and A567). More detailed work is now being progressed on the A57 corridor (bus route 10A) through a current commission, and we are now at a point where we are keen to bring in a partner to support us with further work on the other two routes, (the A562 for bus route 86, and the A567 for bus route 53).
The partner we appoint for this new commission will take responsibility for working with LCRCA and its partners within the City Regions Local Highway Authorities to undertake more detailed work on options appraisal and production of an outline business case by Spring/Summer 2022.

For 2022-25, the City, London Borough of Tower Hamlets and London Borough of Hackney have developed a new partnership to commission a tri-borough service of three Psychotherapists (including a women's specialist worker) and a Service Manager.

2024: 220

The Education sector impacts on each of our lives and can often determine future career paths and progression. It is also a huge employer within the region - employing almost 120,000 people - crucial to GM both as a provider of opportunities to work and as a facilitator for entering other sectors. The Covid-19 pandemic hit the sector hard, with nurseries, schools, colleges, and universities all experiencing periods of closure; forcing them to rapidly develop new ways of learning. The sector will continue to play a key role in the future of GM. Its workforce of today is developing our workforces of tomorrow however, there are systemic problems across the sector exacerbated by immediate skill gaps, highlighted in the Industry Labour Market & Skills Intelligence Report, which must be resolved.

Improving early years outcomes and school readiness levels is a priority in the Greater Manchester Strategy 2021-2031, the GM Children's Health and Wellbeing Framework , Population Health Plan , and the GM Children and Young Peoples' Plan . The early years workforce across GM is varied and comprises of practitioners, teachers, children's centre workers, family support workers, health visitors and social workers. Whilst some of these roles form part of the 'wider' Early Years workforce, they play an important role in improving outcomes of young children and their families.

To realise the ambition to improve early years outcomes, the early years workforce must have the right skills and competencies to help children achieve their potential. Feedback from employers highlights particular challenges which this specification looks to address including:
• Awareness of child development and the impact covid has had on this. Employers feel that the impact of the pandemic is now being felt, particularly with younger people whose social and academic development is behind what would be expected for their age.
• SEND awareness and training for Early Years staff at Level 3+
• The need for flexible provision to meet the needs of both employers and employees, including evening and weekend learning. There should be an understanding that whilst staffing shortages and financial constraints remain - training staff is often difficult due to backfill costs when keeping to staffing ratios.
• Accredited online learning. Practitioners in the sector have commented that they have accessed more training online than ever before; online courses should be accredited wherever possible.

It provides space for visitors and residents to socialise in an outdoor environment as a current pandemic measure and also supports long term city centre vitality and vibrancy.

The street is challenged by its current street scene layout and surface condition, and it is yet to achieve its full public realm potential.

Therefore, Oxford City Council are commissioning feasibility design and engagement work to build on the success of the current scheme and explore opportunities to create an exemplary permanent pedestrianised zone which enhances the city centre public realm.

OCC have undertaken preliminary work, so this brief incorporates the current understanding of technical requirements, headline constraints and opportunities, an initial stakeholder list and engagement scope. It is an OCC project, however Oxfordshire County Council (""County"") as highway authority, will be key stakeholders throughout, alongside other local landowners and interest groups. If a permanent scheme is to be delivered, it will need to be approved by County, however that stage is outside of the scope of this project.

K-7-13-2-1-8-1,Contract,"National Army Museum",Awarded,2022-08-10T16:57:35+01:00,"Voluntary ex ante transparency notice - National Army Museum Manned Security Contract","The National Army Museum (NAM) requires security presence 24/7 at its sites in Chelsea and Stevenage. The security contractor is required to provide an effective and efficient, overt uniformed manned security service.

Type of procedure:
Negotiated without a prior call for competition
Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority

Explanation:
This is a voluntary ex ante transparency notice pursuant to regulation 99(2) of the Public Contracts Regulations (PCRs). A contract for the provision of manned security was entered into on 01 December 2021 (Contract). NAM considered it objectively necessary to terminate this contract. This was due to a level of performance which NAM regarded as unacceptable as well as a failure to adhere to stated requirements of the contract.

NAM feels compelled to take these steps in order to protect the health and safety of its visitors and staff and to secure its National Collections of valuable historic exhibits telling the story of Our Army and British history. Many of these items have been donated by members of the armed forces or their family members and placed in the care of the Museum. All donors have a legitimate expectation that exhibits entrusted to the Museum will be kept in a secure environment.

The appointment advertised in this notice is of a ""stop-gap"" nature to ensure continuity and to allow the Museum to remain open while a competitive procurement for a more permanent supplier is concluded. It is therefore the intention of NAM in the coming months to launch a competitive procurement process for the permanent appointment of a supplier of manned security services for the Museum under a contract with a duration likely to be in the region of 3-5 years. The contract opportunity will be advertised in the Find a Tender service in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.

NAM considers that there is a legal basis to make a direct procurement under regulation 32(2)(c) of the PCRs as:

(i) NAM is required to act with regard to the security of its sites, its collection and the wellbeing of visitors and staff;

(ii) there is a genuine urgency to ensure security services at the Museum are restored to acceptable levels while avoiding disruption to security coverage;

(iii) after due consideration, NAM has concluded the degree of urgency and the need to ensure continuity of security coverage preclude an appointment under an accelerated procurement procedure or a mini-tender appointment under a framework agreement,

      The Council wishes to procure a prepaid card system for three separate council functions. Three separate on-line systems will be required, and initially between 400 and 500 cards between the three functions (expected to grow in the longer term to 1,000+ cards).
      
      Appointeeship Unit require a system to assist in the administration of client finances where the authority is acting as Appointee / Deputy. This service takes responsibility for the management of finances for customers who are unable to manage their own finances and have no one willing or able to do this for them. The team has an existing contract which is being terminated in October 2022 as the supplier is withdrawing from the market. 
      
      Direct Payments - the council wishes to introduce a prepaid card system as an alternative to the current method which requires each client to set up a specific bank account to receive and pay out their allocated Direct Payment. A direct payment is funding for a person's care and support services which the person has decided to arrange themselves, rather than asking the council to arrange the services for them. Currently, clients are required to account for their use of their Direct Payment care funding by submitting regular paper reports, copies of bank statements plus receipts and invoices to support each payment. 
      
      No Recourse to Public Funds; deal with clients whose legal immigration status in the UK means that they cannot access mainstream benefits and housing assistance. Currently the service makes ad-hoc cash payments to clients who face high needs - very rarely do they make more than two payments to any one client. They wish to introduce a prepaid ""limited load"" card system to replace the current method, so that clients can have funds added to an anonymous card which would expire after a maximum of three loads.
      
      Contract Period
      The contract period will be for 2 years 10 months commencing on 1st June 2022.

As part of an ERDF-funded project, we require suitably competent service providers to deliver Digital Aerial Surveys (DAS) to support bird and marine mammal density and distribution modelling in the UK Celtic Sea area.  The activity will support strategic considerations for Floating Offshore Wind (FLOW) in the Celtic Sea. A brief general project description is provided below:
The Cornwall FLOW Accelerator (CFA) project is a collaborative project including Wave Hub Development Services Development Ltd (WHDS project lead), University of Exeter (UoE), University of Plymouth (UoP) and the Offshore Renewable Catapult (OREC). It aims to develop tools, knowledge and data which accelerate the Celtic Sea FLOW opportunity and lay significant groundwork with respect to developing pipeline at both a FLOW project and supply chain level. The project is part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) 
Celtic Sea Power (CSP) has worked with Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, the JNCC and the RSPB to determine a suitable survey methodology for the proposed DAS that can feed into a regional characterization approach for the area. CSP also have an ambition to combine data and evidence from this proposed survey with other relevant data sets from the remaining Celtic Sea area. This will maximize spatial and temporal data coverage for relevant species that can feed into both Regional and National density and distribution modelling activities. This will also enable a more strategic view to be taken of the key potential species interactions in the area, geographically relevant potential development risks and the pre-empting of additional data and evidence that may be required in the future to support the assessment of FLOW.

Cefas are now coordinating a UK ODA research and development project that aims to develop a risk analysis tool that places hazard identification and control at the heart of sustainable food system design.

The new tool will systematically map data to calculate the impact of complex hazards interacting with the whole food system to demonstrate how hazard control catalyses benefits in terms of yield, profit, trade and biodiversity protection in environments where food production occurs, to enable more climate-efficient food sectors. 

The project seeks to bring together methods focussed on food sector hazards with methods focussed on environmental and climate change assessment.

The intention is to run these installations as a single project that will need careful site management as they are at the base of an occupied residential apartment block.

A separate contractor will provide the council with advice and support for roles including Employer's Agent, CDM, principal, architectural and M&E design.

Unit 1 - Citizens Advice Bureau
To be fitted out to their design and requirement specification (already designed) to best meet the needs of their volunteers and visitors. Works will require installation of interview rooms, back office space, tea point and toilet facilities. This unit was previously utilised as a 'show home' so has a temporary fit out that will need completing and in some areas adapting.

The impact of the pandemic has seen nationally an increase in anxiety, a detrimental impact on young people's mental health and wellbeing which has led to an increase in emotionally based school avoidance. To ensure all pupils are fully supported and able to access education, the Council is seeking a provider who will be able to meet the individual needs of children and young people to successfully support, engage and re-integrate them into education. A programme of effective support, successfully delivered at the appropriate time, is required to ensure every child is able to meet their full potential.

The primary objective of this service is to ensure children and young people are re-integrated to access education at school or their next placement whether it be training, work or college. We anticipate this to be delivered through a flexible approach with on-line education and in-person education pathways, pastoral care and compassion to support the child or young person on their education journey. This is particularly significant for those pupils who have additional support needs and vulnerabilities which can lead to them not fulfilling their potential. The provider will have a progressive or graduated approach to deliver the service outcomes based on an individual child or young person's requirements. The provision will meet the needs of Key Stage 2, Key Stage 3, Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5.

The contract commencement date will be 1st September 2022 to 31st August 2025 (Two optional extensions 1st September 2025 to 31st August 2027 and 1st September 2027 to 31st September 2028).

The estimated contract spend is £170,000 per annum. This is only an estimate and the actual spend maybe higher or lower than these figures.

The Council is of the opinion that TUPE will not apply.

Commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department - Heat Network Delivery Unit (HNDU), Element Energy delivered a heat mapping and master planning study for Lancaster in June 2019.  The study investigated the potential for the development of heat network scheme options in Lancaster and surrounding areas, and the potential benefits such schemes could deliver.  The study also considered potential constraints, risks, and opportunities related to the delivery of heat networks in the region. 
 
Based on the energy data assessment an opportunity for potential heat network clusters has been identified.  A high-level analysis of information such as heat demand across existing buildings and industrial sites, potential low carbon heat sources, planned developments and possible constraints to network development was investigated. 
 
Once defined, each cluster was studied in more detail - qualitatively and quantitatively - to capture key characteristics influencing the viability of heat network schemes such as the volume of heat delivered, the level of stakeholder engagement, the linear heat density and the availability of low-carbon heat sources. 
  
Based on an initial high-level economic assessment of a series of scheme options for each cluster, it was recommended to advance to a detailed techno-economic feasibility study stage the opportunity area covering South Lancaster and City Centre clusters.  
 
This project is to define the study to a greater detail, provide technical modelling for heat demand and heat supply within the selected clusters.  Additionally, this project will provide an outcome in a form of a Techno-Economic model which will evaluate viability for proposed scenarios, including not only potential income revenue streams but also carbon savings. 

REQUIREMENTS 
 
Lancaster City Council is looking to appoint a management consultant to carry out the delivery of a Techno-Economic Feasibility Study (TEF) for the district and identify which of the eight clusters present viable opportunities. At this stage, it's likely these will be clusters within Central and Southern Lancaster area but the study will confirm if this is the case.

The aim of this study:

1     Is to develop a clear set of recommendations, based on detailed technical and economic analysis, as to the feasibility of developing a heat network  scheme for the specified area. The study should be such as to enable the Client to determine whether to invest in progressing the scheme(s).  
2	The recommendations should describe an initial scheme that is deliverable in the short-term and outline the vision for phased network expansion that can be achieved in the long-term.
3	The recommendations should describe the next steps required by the Client to take the project through to commercialisation and construction. 
4	The study should cover the following red line boundary which is smaller than the District boundary and con",,,England,"71311000 71314000 71315000 71600000 ","Robert Boschi",rboschi@lancaster.gov.uk,"Lancaster Town Hall","Dalton Square",Lancaster,"LA1 1PJ","United Kingdom","'+44 1524582000",http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/,,,,23/07/2022,31/03/2023,08/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,95000,95000,22/07/2022,84850.64,"[Anthesis|Floor 1, Fitzroy House, 355 Euston Road, London, Greater London, NW1 3AL, United Kingdom|NONE||No|No]",,19/09/2022,31/03/2023,"Restricted ",,12:00

       The Metropolitan Police Service is famed around the world and has a unique place in the history of policing. It is by far the largest of the police services that operate in the UK. The Royal Parks Constabulary has now become part of the MPS.
      
      Today, the MPS employs approximately 31,141 officers, 13,661 police staff, 414 traffic wardens and 2,106 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), and, since the realignment of police boundaries in April 2000, it covers an area of 620 square miles and a population of 7.2million.
      
      Staff of the MPS (other than police officers) are employed by the MPA but the power to appoint and dismiss them vests in the Commissioner. The MPS covers the area broadly within the boundaries of the M25. Day-to-day policing is the responsibility of 32 Borough Operational Command Units supported by centralised specialist policing units and other management, admin and support functions.

To evaluate and understand the main drivers of a positive reputation for a low-tariff university.
To understand how the University is viewed by different audiences, and to be given the tools in order for us to improve these perceptions where possible. 
o propose an action plan which will:
•	Evaluate and measure the University's current reputational strengths and weaknesses;
•	Identify audiences and actions where it would be most prudent to look to improve the University's reputation (either through the improvement of views among audiences with the most negative views of the institution, or towards audiences or actions which might yield the greatest return on resource investment);
•	Establish measures which could be used in order to track shifts in the University's reputation at a later date;
•	Establish a framework though which continuous improvement can be signposted, realised and measured through marketing and communicating University activity.
