It will provide a command of the underlying species evidence, representing the first steps towards holistic species recovery within Natural England's Nature Recovery Network. It does so by centralising species information in one place in a novel and new way. This Species Evidence Base (SEB) will focus on important species listed in Environment Act targets, notably those associated with the abundance target and the extinction rate target.  

We require specialists to gather the data for Birds that includes 203 species (Species listed in Annex 1). Evidence gathered for each species is split into five categories: Trends, Habitats, Pressures, Climate Change and Actions.  In total there will be approximately 50 fields that need addressing for each species (Provisional fields and parameters list in Annex 2) .   

For most fields, there will parameters on what can be entered- either Yes/No or multiple choice based on a range. Supplier will fill out the fields based on their current knowledge and understanding for each species. We do not expect there to be existing evidence for all the fields for all species and expect that supplier will use their expertise and experience of Birds to provide their best estimate.

In making Direct Payments under section 17A of the 1989 Act, councils are subject to the general duty provided by Part 3 of that Act to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need, and to promote their upbringing by their families when making these payments, in exactly the same way as when providing direct services. The power to make Direct Payments to people with parental responsibility for disabled children and to disabled 16 and 17-year-olds was created by the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000.
If the Local Authority assesses a child or young person requires support to meet identified needs, these needs will be identified on a plan along with an identification of the services that can meet these needs.
If families do not want to use services directly provided or commissioned by the Authority, they have the option of receiving the support by Direct Payments instead. 
A Direct Payment affords a family the flexibility to look beyond 'off-the-peg' service solutions provided by the Authority and choose from a range of alternative employment, education and leisure activities to meet their child's assessed needs. In many cases, the Direct Payment is used to employ a personal assistant to enable a child to access these activities.

Cumbria is currently undergoing a local government reorganisation and Government has announced that Cumbria County Council is to be replaced by two unitary authorities with effect form 01 April 2023.  Cumbria County Council shall be entitled to novate/transfer the Contract(s) to any successor council as defined in The Local Government (Structural Changes) (Transfer of Functions, Property, Rights and Liabilities) Regulations 2008.
The contract has been separated into two specific Lots which cover the geographical footprints of the new authorities - Lot 1 Cumberland and Lot 2 Westmorland and Furness. It is anticipated that contract novation/transfer will occur in accordance with these lots.

The AMSS seeks to improve consistency, standardisation, integration, data accessibility and user experience across the current portfolio of asset management systems. 

Charter 4 (Asset Knowledge) of the Asset Management Transformation Programme (AMTP) is a key tenet of the asset management transformation within the National Highways transformation landscape. The AMTP has ministerial and regulator commitments to deliver. Charter 4 covers 2 sub-charters: Charter 4a (Systems) and Charter 4b (Data). 

The overall ambition of the charter is to deliver a rationalised and integrated Asset Management Systems (AMS) landscape with a relevant and appropriate operating model; that delivers optimised or re-engineered business processes, appropriate data governance and integration (process; data; processes; service; system), between AMS, our strategic platforms (Data- as-a-Service; Oracle Fusion; Works Management Systems, etc.) and decision support tools.

      o Enhancing independence and dignity by enabling citizens to exercise greater control over their daily lives, live at home and be less dependent upon other people. 
      o Reducing isolation by connecting citizens to their social networks and to opportunities in their communities. 
      o Supporting unpaid carers and families by providing reassurance remotely, respite, easy means of communication and reducing demands on their capacity.
      
      The Council requires a consultative innovative partner to work alongside an existing small Technology Enabled Care (TEC) team within Adult Social Care to provide resource, support and additional capacity, whilst adding value in the development of a transformed TEC service as follows (this is not an exhaustive list):
      
      o To work with our experts by experience and key stakeholders, including social care practitioners, in a co-productive approach at every stage of the develop, review, and transform stages of a TEC service and ensuring partner engagement throughout the process
      o To consult with citizens on proposed plans for a transformed TEC service, including analysis of and reports on consultation responses
      o To develop a roadmap for commissioning a transformed TEC service whilst supporting the refresh of the equipment and technology commissioning strategy 
      o To define the scope of a transformed TEC service - in respect of citizen cohorts and partner organisations
      o To design a service operating and delivery model that delivers against the outcomes of TEC strategy and the design principles and critical success factors identified in the TEC business case - these principles are citizen-centric - and that interfaces with and complements social care delivery and practice, makes best use of existing and emerging technologies and realises the potential for TEC to be an enabler of early intervention and prevention through deployment and data aggregation across the Council
      o To undertake an options appraisal of in-house, external and hybrid provider models
      o To develop and part delivery of a communication and culture change programme in advance of the mobilisation commencing for the new service so that citizens and our workforce are ready to make best use of the new TEC service. Noting that both programmes need to be easily transferable for consistency into the mobilisation and service delivery phase
      o To plan for the transition of existing TEC/telecare, ensuring fit with the longer-term model including consideration of the implications of the digital switchover for both the existing and new service
      o To develop an approach for the Council to work with the independent care provider market to enable the use of TEC within the Council's commissioned packages of care

To do this effectively, HSE needs to collect relevant, reliable and representative data from GB businesses of all sectors and sizes in a prompt and cost-effective manner.  These data will inform HSE's statutory, evidence-based products, such as Impact Assessments and Post Implementation Reviews, and its evaluations. Such data will also be key for creating baselines for the evaluation of HSE's strategy. Protecting people and places: HSE strategy 2022 to 203

As the various requirements differ in focus and extent, HSE needs access to a survey mechanism which is suitably adaptable and flexible. To this end, it has previously used this contract to purchase questions on a market-leading business-to-business omnibus survey. This approach has meant that questions can be in-field very quickly, with the number of responses being sizeable and representative (the benefits of a guaranteed achieved sample).

The UK has longstanding and comprehensive regulatory and monitoring regimes for priority chemicals in the environment, meanwhile research programmes both domestically and internationally have furthered human understanding of the potential harms caused by exposure to specific chemicals or groups of chemicals. The stock of existing chemicals that have not yet made their way into the environment and the development of new chemicals for use in processes and products are increasing rapidly and there is a need to better understand the overall effects and costs of damage from exposure. This is key to justifying action and determining the appropriate controls for effectively managing the risks they pose. If not managed appropriately, some chemicals can disrupt the populations of plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms in ways that can lead to ecological change.
Aim
To develop a methodology to measure and quantify the environmental impacts of chemical pollutants in the context of chemicals regulation within the UK. The avoided environmental damage costs from regulation can then be compared against the cost of controls.
Objectives
The objectives of this project are to:

Bar End, Winchester, SO23 0QA.

The greenfield site has been vested in perpetual trust as open land for public 
playing fields. The area north of the access road has been demarcated for a new 
pavilion development. The playing fields are currently served by two sports 
pavilions which do not meet current standards, are not of adequate size and are in a deteriorating state of repair and condition. These existing pavilions are to be 
demolished outside of the main works contract.
 
The project proposes the construction of a modern and compliant two-storey sports
 pavilion which will accommodate: a first-floor clubhouse with a kitchen and 
external open viewing balcony, ground-floor changing rooms with associated 
showers, officials changing, separate toilets, storage, external bike shelter and 
bin store. The pavilion will also have a first-floor balcony viewing area. 
Landscaping includes alterations to the access route, car parking, drainage, paving and installation of EV chargers together with other associated works. 

Stride Treglown Architecture & Design Practice have developed a design which 
is attractive, of high quality, efficient and economical to maintain. It is hoped 
that the new Pavilion will serve the current and future needs of the clubs, players, officials and spectators of all ages, cultures, abilities and gender. 

The works are to be procured and administered under the JCT Design and Build 
Contract 2016. 

Works must be completed on-site by August 2023 in anticipation of the next football season.

The Nuclear AMRC (https://www.namrc.co.uk) has a requirement for a Flash Analyser for measuring thermal diffusivity to support manufacturing research activities within the nuclear sector.  The currently proposed materials characterisation equipment namely, Flash diffusivity technique will add extra capability to Nuclear AMRC's existing materials testing facility. This capability facilitates measurement of valuable and important parameters such as thermal diffusivity on heat transfer across applied materials to elevated temperatures, Room Temperature (RT - around 20-22°C) to 1600°C. For example, thermo-mechanical treatments in steel, heat treatments in steel/alloys and production processes of heat removal materials affect it's structural properties. These underlying changes can be assessed by this technique that enables measurement of variations in thermal transport property non-destructively. In addition, the flash technique will be a great tool in analysing and generating experimental thermal database including for (but not limited to) newly developed steels/alloys, ceramics and composites.

The flash diffusivity equipment is to be installed at the Nuclear AMRC's metallurgical laboratory workspace and will be a great addition to already installed Dilatometer and DSC techniques in generating accurate thermophysical /thermodynamic database for advanced nuclear materials from room temperature to 1600 °C. 

In the case of heat removal materials property analysis, the thermal diffusivity and specific heat data obtained from this technique in addition to density measurements from our Dilatometer can be combined to estimate the important transport property, i.e. thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. Depending on the thermal history and metallurgical structural changes induced, the variations in transport properties will infer suitable process selection or recommend further improvements on the production process.
In addition, reliable values of thermophysical properties of industrially important materials such as ferrous and non-ferrous, composites, ceramics, heat resistant alloys and other vast range of materials can be assessed using the flash diffusivity method.

The full technical specification will be sent to you once you have expressed your interest

KCC telephony payments must be PCI compliant and therefore not record the customer card details or sensitive authentication data in the recording of the call or to the advisor.
A system is required to ensure card transactions can be completed over the phone.  This system must have the following requirements:
•	Card details are entered via the keypad by the customer and the advisor cannot see or hear the details but can still speak to the customer via an 'agent assist' solution so the advisor can guide the customer through the transaction.
•	Visible payment portal for advisor to see/hear if transaction successful.
•	Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) call masking (changes the variable keypad tones to flat tones so they cannot be identified).
•	The system and network are also secure and compliant with firewall and router.
•	Automated payment line without the advisor where the customer can call the line and complete a payment without advisor intervention but transferable to a live advisor (if available).
•	Customisable values and call flow/script.
•	Integrates with existing account and merchant provider.
•	Integrates with existing telephony provider.
•	All major cards accepted.
•	Web payments.
•	Defined user support channel and available 24/7.
•	Concurrent or transactional licences (not named).

The Police and Crime Commissioner is looking for a supplier to deliver a 12-month intervention service in the Halton (Runcorn and Widnes) and Warrington areas to raise awareness around and address the needs of local young people who are on the periphery of or already involved in serious violence and associated criminality e.g., County Lines drug activity, Childhood Exploitation.

In recognition of the fact that many young people are involved in such criminality because of being exploited during tender and vulnerable years, this service seeks to make available some expert provision to intervene at an early stage in the lives of these young people. This service will be primarily an educational mentoring programme that utilises a contextual safeguarding methodology to facilitate a positive impact on young people, their families, schools, and communities. 

The service seeks to educate young people around the actual risks involved in such activity and assist them in making better life choices to successfully divert them away from a life of crime and allow them to lead meaningful lives, contributing successfully to society and reduce reoffending and violence.

The timescales for the delivery of this service are challenging, as such it is anticipated that the successful provider will already have aspects of this programme ready for delivery with reasonable adjustments or have the expertise available to quickly use that knowledge to develop the relevant aspects. This needs to be ready for a December 2022 implementation and roll out to commence January 2023 in line with the start of the school term.

The Budget allocated for this scheme (initial contract) is £180,000.

The contract will have the facility to be extended up to 31st March 2026 subject to funding availability. The maximum value of the contract should it be extended will be up to the Light Touch Threshold value of 552,950 (ex VAT)

      Textile mills are a regional priority for Historic England. Our Mills of the North Campaign  aims to secure the sustainable reuse of these significant and valued assets to provide economic, social and environmental benefits to people across the north. This cross-region programme has a national profile and serves as a potential model for industrial heritage and other thematic programmes across the country.  A key step is enabling local authorities to secure high-quality placemaking through good design with effective integration and consideration of the historic environment. 
      
      The aims of this project are to 
      o Provide an exemplar for local authorities across the North West and Yorkshire Regions in particular to use design coding as a tool alongside local plan policy to promote the sensitive reuse of their mill heritage to deliver 
              significant and beneficial change.

The LAA is responsible for the provision of all publicly funded civil and criminal legal aid advice in England and Wales.  The LAA is therefore required to procure the services of external legal aid providers and develop the service of legal advice that the providers undertake for clients as well as, arrange and operate a variety of commercial contracts to discharge the Lord Chancellor's duty to ensure access to justice.
Given the breadth of LAA contracts and the complex procurement processes used to award such contracts, a wide range of complex legal issues arise.  The legal aid market is inherently litigious due to long-standing and well publicised funding challenges associated with the provision of legal aid and there are widespread sustainability issues.  The LAA is also subject to increasing scrutiny from pressure groups and charities representing the rights of those reliant on legal aid services.  In addition, the LAA is subject to political pressures as a result of government policy and Ministerial objectives that significantly impact the LAA's procurement strategies. The LAA's service deliverables also link with various MoJ and wider government areas such as; immigration, prisons and courts. The LAA therefore requires expert external legal support to assist the limited GLD commercial legal resource working with the LAA to advise on commercial law issues including procurement strategy and contracts in order to mitigate risk to the LAA and the risks of successful legal challenges.
Notably, the Lord Chancellor has a legal duty to ensure access to justice.

This research, and strengthening of connections between academia and policy making, will ensure that PALs is an effective and efficient program of work.
      
      Executive summary of research:
      The new threats faced in the crowded spaces arena has caused a significant amount of discussion around how the public domain is now protected. The threat to traditional targets hasn't gone away but the threat to new unspecified locations through low complexity attack is now the primary threat. The strategic impact of the PALs programme is to make the public safer from terrorist attacks when using Publicly Accessible Locations (PALs).
      The strategic impact for NaCTSO is the development of new ways of working, policies, processes and tools in readiness for the new PALs Policy and the implementation of the Protect Duty within CT Policing. This portfolio of change projects has formed the PALs Programme.
       
      The CTSA network is the operational arm of NaCTSO and the CTSA is currently the primary means of surveying, reviewing and advising identified risk sites around the United Kingdom regarding protective security arrangements. The policy objectives they deliver are set by the Homeland Security Group (HSG), they are tasked through NaCTSO and the Protect and Prepare (P&P) leads, paid for by CT Grant, but employed by individual police forces around the country. Whilst their training and qualifications are controlled centrally, in practice, there is a wide variety of approaches nationally to achieve the same thing.
      NaCTSO are consulting the P&P network on potential new ways of working that are currently being tested and developed by the PALs Programme work streams, as these could form the scope of the Future Operating Model (FOM). The CTSA X consultation will help to identify potential areas of conflict and/or resistance to change from this crucial network. 
      A wholesale review and fundamental restructure of the CTSA network is under consideration as part of a portfolio of changes that maybe required in NaCTSO to meet the challenges ahead.  
      
      Aim:
      The aim of the CTSA Network consultation is to present proposals to the CTSA network about its role in the NaCTSO FOM. These proposals are based on internal feedback, formal reviews such as the NaCTSO Business Assurance Process (BAPs) and what we understand of the draft Protect Duty legislation.
      
      These activities will allow NaCTSO to understand the potential impacts of these proposals and assist the programme to develop the mechanisms needed to support the CTSA network through the likely challenges this transitionary period will bring.",,,"United Kingdom,Isle of Man,Channel Islands,British Oversea Territories,Europe,Rest of the World","73110000 ","Paul  Hirst",paul.hirst@met.police.uk,"Empress State Building Empress Approach",,London,SW61TR,UK,07920021335,,,"https://www.competefor.com/business/viewOpportunityDetailsSupplier.html?id=66189109 ","The standard terms and conditions have been attached for your information, if you are unable to comply with our terms and conditions please do not bid for this contract.

Finding good facilitators who can work with teams across HE is not easy and relies on facilitators having a variety of tools, approaches and methods, a flexibility of style and the ability to understand HE and its people so they can have rapport and can challenge the individuals and teams.

South Cambridgeshire is a largely rural district with few food banks. Often community foodbanks are created for the purpose of supporting residents who live within that community and do not extend beyond the bounds of the Parish.  

Therefore SCDC is looking for a suitably qualified and experienced contractor to provide food support for our Warm Hubs where there is no community food provision.  

The aim of the food parcel distributor will be to provide support to those most vulnerable to help mitigate the cost of living crisis.  The food provider will offer a nutritionally balanced parcel of foods to meet emergency food needs of the individual or a family.
