A commissioning review of the service commenced in October 2021 for the Assessment and Equipment service for people who are D/deaf, deafened and Hard of Hearing. The soft market testing exercise which was published earlier in the year concluded with no expressions of interest, highlighting the limited availability of specialist providers in the marketplace for this service and attendance at the regional benchmarking group also confirms the limited supply of specialist sensory impairment providers at a regional and local level.\r
\r
Furthermore, Action Deafness confirmed their interest in continuing to deliver the service, though completing a tender bid would reduce capacity to deliver the service.\r

      The requirement for focus group research in the DPH Annual Report is driven by the need to illustrate and understand citizen's voices within the work of Public Health and Birmingham City Council.

      For each focus group, providers will be required to:
      o recruit participants.
      o ensure that the setting for the focus group/s is a safe and accessible environment which  considers the needs of the group member/s.
      o ensure participants complete consent forms for participation including audio-recordings.
      o capture data relating to the views of citizens around the use of digital technology in improving  their own health as well as the wider health of the public.
      o gain a greater understanding of these views through appropriate analysis of the data.
      o capture specific quotes from participants in relation to the topic of digital technology and  health. 
      o conduct conversations in person or via web-based video calls (or other non-face to face  methods where practical).
      
      We are looking to fund a series of focus groups.  Providers may bid for a minimum of one and a maximum of three focus groups. Each bid must be for a separate target group.  See below.

The City of London Corporation (contracting as the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London) and the City of London Police, as the Authority is putting in place a Framework Agreement for provision of Integrated Facilities Management (IFM) services, for use by UK public sector bodies.

IFM is the consolidation of Facility Management (FM) services under a single supplier including hard and soft FM services bringing efficiencies in contract management, supply chain, project management and collaborative planning.

The Framework will be divided into six Lots reflecting property groups:

- Lot 1 - Corporate Property
- Lot 2 - Commercial Property
- Lot 3 - Performing Arts Venues
- Lot 4 - Heritage property / Mixed Use (including Office Space, Events, & Archives)
- Lot 5 - Schools
- Lot 6 - Police and Courts

By dividing property groups into six Lots which reflect the customer and clients&apos; requirements, tailored service delivery models can be delivered in an integrated manner to provide FM services with differing objectives and drivers based on clients&apos; needs and contract specifications which are adapted to meet these differing and unique requirements.

Suppliers can submit proposals to be shortlisted for Lots without restriction (i.e. suppliers can propose to be shortlisted for all six Lots).

The Environment Agency wishes to gather up-to-date information on the use and environmental presence of known and suspected EDCs in the UK, so that risk management can be targeted in the most effective way.

A number of chemicals are authorised for use within the UK as UV-filters in cosmetics under Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products (recast). Whilst none have been formally identified as an endocrine disruptor under EU or UK legislation, some have been subject to regulatory scrutiny under EU REACH, with three currently under substance evaluation for endocrine concerns. In addition, some UV filters have been identified as potentially being Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) or very Persistent, very Bioaccumulative (vPvB).

This project has two objectives: 
1) To identify the relevant substances that are part of this group and then collect publicly available information about the level of supply, use and environmental exposure of these substances with a focus on the UK. 
2) To identify those substances from this group of chemicals that are/potentially are EDC, PBT and vPvB substances.""",,,"United Kingdom","73210000 ","Estelle Nma",Estelle.Nma@environment-agency.gov.uk,"Environment Agency (Trentside Offices)","Lady Bay Bridge","West Bridgford","NG2 5FA",England,,,"Award Letter - Overview of EDCs - UV filters in cosmetics _Redacted.pdf ",,,17/08/2022,31/01/2023,20/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,31514,,17/08/2022,31514,"[Wood Group Uk Ltd|Wsp House, 70 Chancery Lane, London, England, WC2A 1AF|COMPANIES_HOUSE|2190074|No|No]",,17/08/2022,31/01/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,17:00

The negative environmental impacts of the food system, increasing food insecurity and the prevalence of unhealthy diets are driving policymakers, scientists, companies, and consumers to demand sustainable solutions. Globally, livestock emits 14.5% of GHGs, causes 30% of biodiversity loss, and meat demand is projected to double by 2050. Transitioning diets to more sustainable sources of protein is therefore crucial. Plant-based food is currently one of the fastest growing food trends but are rather unsustainably dependent on soy (>60% of the segment). A trans-national and inter-disciplinary consortium consists of ~20 natural/social scientists and engineers from seven universities and two industrial partners across six countries in the three continents (Europe, Africa & Asia) has co-designed the project IPSUS to address Net Zero opportunity by connecting sustainable protein shift and food waste valorisation. This will exploit opportunities for extracting upcycled plant and seaweed proteins from raw materials otherwise destined to join the ~1.6 billion tonnes of annual global food loss and waste (FLW).
Plant-based meat and cheese alternatives using livestock-free protein sources such as legumes, oilseeds and cereals are gaining importance for addressing the need for a sustainable protein transition. Increasing the use of underutilised protein-rich by-products for such applications would be a transformative breakthrough. The IPSUS project will facilitate future-fit food system transformation in a resource efficient way by connecting sustainable protein shift (i.e. plant and seaweed protein-based food) to FLW valorisation. In the UK, the IPSUS project's focus will be on FLW upcycling opportunities from two of the following sources, potato, brewer's spent grain, and seaweed.",,,"Any region","73110000 ",XX,procurement@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,www.defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Project_ 36125_Contract_IPSUS_Redacted.pdf ",,,15/04/2022,14/04/2025,16/08/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,,17/08/2022,168289,"[University of Bristol, Bristol Veterinary School, Faculty of Hea|University of Bristol, Dolberry Building, Langford Campus, North Somerset, BS40 5DU|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,15/04/2022,14/04/2025,"Other ERA-NET FOSC-SUSFOOD2",,15:00

We Eat Balanced is AHDB's flagship consumer marketing campaign, launched as a pilot in January 2021. The We Eat Balanced social media channels were initially launched to host advertising content for this pilot, but due to the successful results, 'always on' social media activity has since been activated, as well as further large TV-led advertising campaign bursts.
AHDB does have an in-house social media team, however they currently do not have enough capacity to support this workstream in full, hence it has so far been outsourced, but it may be brought back in-house in future.
Note: although this brief focuses on We Eat Balanced, there's potential for AHDB to also need support for its other social media channels in future.

There is an immediate and enduring need to provide Obsolescence Management training for designated people in Obsolescence Manager roles to ensure effective management of assets with considerable savings to the taxpayer. Without investment in Obsolescence Management Training, there will be a significant and negative impact on operational availability and through life costs. Doing nothing will perpetuate an unsustainable situation whereby Obsolescence Managers are ill equipped to carry out their duties.

Requirement
This proposal forms part of Support Improvement Programme Intent 1 - Professionalise Support. It fills a current gap in the provision of externally recognised qualifications for Obsolescence Managers within the iLog Function. To ensure high quality standard of learning, the proposal indicates that training should be accredited to the International Institute of Obsolescence Management (IIOM) and be at IIOM Associate level.

OXFS001-DN615667-46719949,Contract,"Oxfordshire County Council",Awarded,2022-09-30T15:43:13+01:00,"Oxfordshire Strategic Active Travel Network (SATN) Project/Consultancy Brief","Oxfordshire County Council (OCC) is seeking to appoint a consultant to produce a Strategic Active Travel Network (SATN) for Oxfordshire.  The SATN was designated as a priority workstream by the OCC Active Travel Programme Board in March 2021 and fits with the objectives of the new OCC administration.

The SATN will be part of a wider set of strategic and policy work aimed at improving the way active travel infrastructure is designed, implemented and maintained. OCC is currently developing its new Local Transport and Connectivity Plan (LTCP) which, along with its supporting strategies, will set out the direction, policies and objectives to be pursued in the following years.  The underlying ambition across all of these documents is to enable a radical transformation in travel patterns; specifically, a reduction of trips by cars and other private motorised vehicles and an increase in active travel and use of public transport.

From a strategic perspective, active travel is currently being planned primarily through Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIP's).  At present, three LCWIP's have been approved in Oxfordshire (Oxford, Bicester and Kidlington) and four more are at different stages of development (Banbury, Witney, Abingdon and Didcot), with the aim of completing them throughout 2022-23.  OCC is planning to roll out further LCWIP's in the coming years, following a prioritisation exercise that will consider resident population, key trip generators and major development sites.  The SATN will help to provide an indication of important strategic routes in rural parts of the county where LCWIPs are unlikely to be developed.

The Oxfordshire Cycling Network (OCN), a network of local cycling groups and campaigners, developed a proposal for a ""Strategic Cycling Network for Oxfordshire"" in 2017 .  This has been a major inspiration for the prioritisation of SATN as a strategic project for active travel development in the county. OCC is expecting that OCN's methodology and proposed routes will be an important starting point for the SATN.

Short breaks are a term used to refer to a range of services for disabled children, many of which used to be known as respite. The legislation in England requires local authorities to provide family carers' of disabled children with breaks so that they can continue to care. The Children with Disabilities Service in Bexley recently carried out a comprehensive consultation exercise with parents/carers in Bexley with children and young people with disabilities.

There are two key tasks: 

Task 1: Review current processes for providing oversight of train service operations in Great Britain
This is expected to include the following activities:
•	Review of the range of current contracts in place between DfT and Train Operating Companies (TOCs), with particular focus on new National Rail Contracts (NRCs) (to the extent that these are indicators of the likely form of future Passenger Service Contracts (PSCs)).
•	Review of the processes currently in place for assuring the procurement of these train service operations contracts.
•	Review of the processes currently in place for monitoring these train service operations contracts (again, with focus on NRCs). This should include the data collected, the monitoring processes and the outputs.
•	Presentation of findings to ORR, including through a written report.

Task 2: Use outputs of task 1 to inform options and proposals for ORR's future oversight of train service operations 
This is expected to include the following activities:
•	Review of published documents on rail reform proposals, and likely content of future PSCs. Engagement with key internal ORR stakeholders on current role / latest understanding of future role. In both cases, this is to inform development of options and proposals. 
•	Document future rail industry structure and responsibilities with particular focus on ORR (including where there is ambiguity to be resolved).
•	Informed by task 1, set out options and proposals for ORR's approach to monitoring Great British Railway's procurement and management of train service operations contracts. 
•	Deliver a workshop with ORR internal stakeholders to discuss options / proposals.
•	For each option / proposal set out the likely incremental ORR capabilities / resource required.",,,"United Kingdom","79000000 ","Gayle Webster",gayle.webster@orr.gov.uk,"25 Cabot Square",,London,E144QA,England,02072823944,,"ORR CT 22-15 ITT Developing ORR role monitoring train service operations.docx ORR CT 22-15 Disclaimer.doc ORR CT 22-15 Form of Agreement - Professional Services.docx ORR CT 22-15 Form of Tender.doc Bravosolution Joining Instruction for open tender.doc ",,"This tender exercise is being conducted via our procurement portal Bravo.

Brief Description of Requirement
BEIS is looking for a contractor or contractors to gather UK non-nuclear radioactive discharges data and then write an official report on behalf of UK government for submission to an international audience. The gathered data must be analysed and processed into reporting templates (this entails the application of good data management practices (data quality checking, data verification and data sorting) as well as identifying whether discharges can reach an OSPAR maritime region).   

The UK is a Contracting Party of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the OSPAR Convention). Under the OSPAR Convention the UK is obliged to submit data from the non-nuclear sector (and nuclear sector but this is dealt with separately) on an annual basis. This requirement is contained within the OSPAR Radioactive Substances Strategy where it commits the OSPAR Commission to annually collect data on discharges from the non-nuclear sector. The UK is signed up to the OSPAR Convention (North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy 2030, NEAES2030 and so regular reporting is required in order to review progress towards the targets of the Radioactive Substances Strategy

service, and have been left in an attempt to manipulate consumer perception or target a
particular business.
The policy proposals are currently in development and are subject to further evidence
gathering and cost-benefit analysis. Although there are wide ranging estimates from various
consumer groups and review sites on the prevalence of fake reviews,2,3,4 the evidence base
on the harm they cause to consumers is relatively underdeveloped. Therefore, this research
will provide high-quality evidence to the policy and analytical teams that cannot be achieved
using internal resources primarily due to time constraints as well as some skill constraints.
Government plans to consult on the details of the developing policy proposals in due course.
An impact assessment (IA) assessing the costs and benefits of the policy options is
expected to be published alongside the consultation. This research is intended to help
develop the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and inform the policy solution. It is expected that the
outputs of this research will:
 Improve understanding of the scale of the problem of fake reviews and how they
impact consumers
 Influence the development of the policy by testing potential solutions and ensuring
policy making is evidence based

-	Directive 2008/50/EC, Regulation 26 of the English Regulations (the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 (2010/1001) imposes a limit value for nitrogen dioxide at an average of 200ug/m3 in any given hour (which is not to be exceeded more than 18 times in a calendar year) and an average of 40ug/m3 which applies to each calendar year. 
-	Article 23 imposes a three-fold obligation on the Secretary of State; to achieve compliance by the soonest date possible; to choose a route to that objective which reduces exposure as quickly as possible; and to take steps which mean meeting the value limits is not just possible, but likely.
-	The development and provision of two air quality barriers alongside the A3 at Guildford is predicted to enable National Highways to support the Government in reaching compliance levels for cleaner air for Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) Link 17736 (A3 Guildford) in the shortest timescale possible and improve the quality of air for sensitive receptors in proximity to the barriers.
-	This scheme aligns with the Roads Investment Strategy aims to protect the environment and improve it, through the Air Quality theme of National Highways' Designated Funds.
-	The project will support National Highway's ""Our Roadmap to Net Zero by 2050"" (July 2021). The plan includes the following commitments and aims: 
-	By 2030 National Highway's operations will become net zero.
-	By 2040 all construction and maintenance activities carried out on the Strategic Road Network will be net-zero.

Owing to the increase and demands on placements for children who have been Permanently excluded or risk of Permanent Exclusion there was the necessity to review and analyse the current provision available for these children.
From September 2022, The Local Authority propose to procure and develop Pathway Development Centres for 25 Key Stage 4 students. These students may remain on their mainstream school roll or may be registered with the school who is providing the education. The providers will be registered for KS4 provision, they will not be mainstream schools.
The Local Authority proposes that there will be 25 places for the most difficult to engage children. These can be from one or more providers. They will work in partnership with Local Authority to support reengagement and identify the support and provision required to successfully transition to post 16 education or training.

In recent years the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as object detection, object classification, segmentation, semantic information extraction from images and videos, denoising, etc. has yielded important results in terms of visual and other sensory perception. However, this requires significant volumes of relevant, high-quality annotated data to achieve adequate levels of performance.

Potential Contractors proposing to submit a Tender are advised to read all documents contained within the Tender Pack carefully to ensure that they are fully familiar with the nature and extent of the obligations to be accepted by them if their Tender is accepted by the Authority.

Potential Contractors should note the Procurement Strategy for this process is to engage a Preferred Contractor following the conclusion of the Stage 1 tender process. At this point, the Preferred Contractor will enter into a Pre-Contract Services Agreement (PCSA) for an 8-week period which will allow the Preferred Contractor to work collaboratively with the Project Team to achieve a scheme capable of delivery within the quality, programme and budgetary requirements which are stipulated within the Key Project Deliverables of the Project Brief Document. Stage 2 will act as an enabler to the project through the undertaking of investigative works, enabling construction and/or deconstruction works.
Mobilising at this stage will reduce the overall project duration and inform the design development before the financial close of the project at the conclusion of Stage 2. This should serve to reduce the risk profile for unforeseen works. The Contractor who is in second place following the Stage 1 tender evaluation will be held in reserve and may be called upon to commence Stage 2 of the process if the Preferred Contractor is not able to provide a solution that is deliverable within the financial and programme parameters during the designated stage 2 period.  

At the end of Stage 2 and if a developed scheme is in line with the Key Project Deliverables and project funding then the Authority and Preferred Contractor will enter a JCT Contract which will be further detailed during the stage 2 process.

However, if the Preferred Contractor is not able to provide a solution that is deliverable within the financial and programme parameters during the designated stage 2 8-week period the Authority may terminate the procedure with the Preferred Contractor with immediate effect. If this happens, the Contractor who is in second place following the Stage 1 tender evaluation could be called in to commence Stage 2 with the Authority which may include enabling works.  

The Preferred Contractor shall be required to provide 'open book' accounting throughout Stage 2.

This Procurement Strategy is further detailed within Section 4 of the Project Brief.
