Nature and extent of the modifications (with indication of possible earlier changes to the contract): 

Variation 1 - Correction of incorrect contract end date 

Variation 2 - Add   business   change   capability required   for   the   successful implementation of ICM.   

Variation 3 - Add further business change capability required for the successful implementation of Orbit, previously known as ICM. 

Variation 4 - Additional licences required. 

Variation 5 - Described below. 

 

Variation 5 - Need for additional works, services or supplies by the original contractor. (Description of the economic or technical reasons and the inconvenience or duplication of cost preventing a change of contractor): 

 

Following a competitive procurement process, FCDO contracted with NTT Data UK for the delivery of an Integrated Case Management system ( including configuration of a COTS product, along with provision of support and maintenance of the system once live). Since contracting with NTT Data,  FCDO has identified new business needs requiring additional services which have become necessary and which were unforeseen when the original procurement process was conducted.   

It is not possible for a supplier other than NTT Data to deliver these additional  services for technical reasons as the additional services require knowledge of the system (of which NTT Data have exclusive working knowledge), access to the systems back-end and project specific IPR. Therefore, due to the need for interchangeability and interoperability with existing equipment, services or installations procured under the initial procurement, this work cannot be delivered by any supplier other than NTT Data.  

 
In addition, contracting with a new supplier for delivery of these additional services would cause significant inconvenience and substantial duplication of costs for FCDO. Given the interoperability issues identified above (particularly NTT Data's exclusive working knowledge of the system developed to date and the impact of IPR restrictions), the time required to run a competition to establish another appropriate supplier, and then to mobilise and transition the services, would result in substantial and unacceptable delay to the programme of at least 12-18 months, as well as result in significant duplication of costs for FCDO.

A working group comprising Hydrogen Sussex, the University of Brighton, Brighton & Hove City Council, and Greater South-East Net Zero Hub (GSZH) are co-ordinating a hydrogen investment proposition (strategy). The overall aims are:
1.	To encourage and support development of a strong hydrogen sector in the Greater Brighton and wider Sussex region.
2.	To secure broad economic benefit from public sector and private sector support for development of regional Hydrogen production and use.

The overarching investment proposition will give a clear focus and priorities for investment, establish a place-based perspective, help key stakeholders understand the opportunities in the region, and prepare the ground for significant funding applications. 
The investment proposition has two key areas of focus:

The contracts covered by this contract award notice are short term awards for 3 months that NHS England awarded pursuant to ministerial direction to enable NHS commissioners across England to make arrangements for additional capacity in response to the Omicron variant to Covid-19.

Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition in the Official Journal of the European Union in the cases listed below
•	Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the directive
Explanation:
The organisations listed in this notice provide a mix of NHS funded and/or private health services and had capacity to provide inpatient, outpatient and critical care to ensure that the NHS would have sufficient capacity to meet the potential demand of the Omicron variant to the Covid-19 Pandemic. The urgent need for these 3 month contracts to be awarded to the listed providers to ensure service continuity to the NHS patients through Quarter 4 of the financial year 2020/21 only became apparent during December 2021 as the combination (and potential impact) of the following became fully evident:
• rapid rise in infection rates and hospitalisations as a result of the novel Omicron variant to Covid-19;

Explanation: Competition is absent for technical reasons, Contract Regulation 32. 2 b (ii)

The Guildhall School of Music and Drama is a world-renowned music conservatoire providing training to musicians, actors and theatre technicians. In order to ensure its international reputation, teaching standards and to continue to attract world class students from around the globe the school aims to provide teaching facilities and equipment that match today's expected industry standards.

Almost all recognised pianists have had training and a subsequent career performing on Steinway pianos. Since its ground-breaking design in 1876, the Steinway concert piano has been almost ubiquitous in concert halls, conservatoires and music studios. In classical music the Steinway piano is considered the industry standard.

In Guildhall School, it can be expected that the pianos will be used for making music for up to 103 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, placing demands on the mechanical instrument that can only be met from the highest quality of manufacture. Steinway pianos have been proven over many years by the Guildhall School to both meet the expectation of the musician and hold up to the extreme level of use demanded by the School.

This School has an ongoing lease agreement with Steinways for the supply of Principal Study teaching piano. Currently the School leases 12 Steinway B pianos on a 5 year plan. The School is looking to renew this lease agreement from September 2022, this time for 16 Steinway B pianos (8 Pianos will be leased for 5 years in September 2022 and 8 pianos will be leased for 5 years in September 2023).

Market research was undertaken to establish Steinways as the sole supplier of 16 Steinway Model B pianos. A Soft Market Test was undertaken in February 2022.

The point of transition from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) is recognised as a point of potential upheaval for young people who may find it difficult to navigate new service settings, or to manage their mental health following discharge from CAMHS, especially as the availability and offer of support can change dramatically from CAMHS to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) or voluntary sector services.

The transition out of CAMHS must be supported by a robust and coordinated multi-agency approach to transition planning. This process is further strengthened by early and effective planning, which may start as young as 15 or as late as 25 and putting the young person at the centre of the process to help them prepare. The process, in many ways a preparation for adulthood, will need to support young people to be as independent as possible. Despite this, services often remain poorly coordinated, and it is vulnerable service users and their families who are left to suffer.

The maximum annual budget is £396,089. The service commencement date is 1st October 2022 for a term of 3 years plus the option to extend for a further 24 months. The value within this Notice is a maximum limit which is inclusive of all options. £1,980,445.00",,,"East of England","85323000 ","NHS West Essex Clinical Commissioning Group",cariad.burgess@attain.co.uk,"Building 4 Spencer Close, The Plain,",,Epping,"CM16 6TN",England,,https://westessexccg.nhs.uk/,,,"The Contracting Authorities participating in the publication of this Contract Award Notice are:

RFQ response Deadline: 8th April 2022
London Borough of Camden is seeking responses to an RFQ process for the provision of Stay and Play drop-in services for children under 5 years and their mums, dads & carers.

Stay & Play drop-ins
Stay and Play drop-ins are provided by Camden Early Years' Service and VCS organisations across the borough. Stay and Play services directly provided and funded through IEYS aim to support families with children under 5 years by offering easily accessible, inclusive play sessions in local neighbourhoods and communities.
Stay and Play services:
Support mothers, fathers, and carers to support their children's learning and development through play and positive interactions
Help families to become aware of the range of services available and how to access support
Provide a place for mothers, fathers and carers to meet together, reducing social isolation and enabling positive engagement in their local community
Borough-wide implementation
The Early Years' Service operates a locality model, with 5 localities across the borough. These are Euston, Kentish Town East, Kentish Town West, Kilburn Priory and Kings Cross & Holborn. There is one children's centre hub in each locality. Work is currently underway to re-purpose some of the Early Years' nurseries to create additional children's centres. The re-purposed buildings are Hampden (Euston locality), Konstam (Kentish Town East) and Rhyl (Kentish Town West).
Opportunity
We will be procuring Stay & Play provision delivered by Camden VCS organisations to ensure all families, especially those that are most disadvantaged, have access to stay and play drop-ins across the borough in a range of venues. The total annual value of the contract is £70K.
There is an opportunity:
To provide stay and play drop-ins for mums, dads and carers and their children
For IEYS and VCS organisations to work in partnership to support families in the early years

In order to support the delivery of this programme, we are seeking tenders from experienced organisations with capacity and expertise to facilitate and co-ordinate the work of play and activity provision during the school holidays with local organisations.

Research has shown that the school holidays can be pressure points for some families. For some children this can lead to a holiday experience gap, with children from low-income households being:
•	less likely to access organised out-of-school activities
•	more likely to experience 'unhealthy holidays' in terms of nutrition and physical health
•	more likely to experience social isolation

The DfE HAF programme is a response to this issue, with evidence showing that free holiday clubs can have a positive impact on children and young people, and that they work best when they:
•	provide consistent and easily accessible enrichment activities
•	cover more than just breakfast or lunch
•	involve children (and parents) in food preparation
•	use local partnerships and connections, particularly with the voluntary and community organisation sector

This is how the idea of establishing GitLife Biotech and the development of the CellRepo technology, as a versioning control system for engineered cell lines, including biotechnology microorganisms, in the cloud was born.
The plan is to spin out GitLife Biotech Ltd in Q3 2022. To be able to spin out and take forward this opportunity, securing the involvement of experienced and appropriate business leadership is both essential and complementary to the existing technical staff and resource.  
Commercial and business skills are needed in addition to those in the current team. Moreover, it is clearly the case that Prof. Krasnogor and the current team will need to remain focused on the scientific and technical aspects of the company and be able to place trust in and be guided by experienced staff (ideally with sector experience, networks and VC contacts) who will run the  day-to-day business operations and  company's strategic development. 
Thus, a talented and experienced CEO (Designate) to assist in the development of the business plans and forecasting needed to spin out the company from the University, as well as to provide leadership of GitLife Biotech, is needed. 
The person appointed to lead the company formation and development will have experience in business start -ups, deeptech companies or University Spin Outs, marketing, innovation and fund raising.

The research will outline the options available and what organisational funding models and processes need to be in place to enable this. We want to understand how to build capability and resilience with partners and in local communities to achieve these social outcomes and show the impact of investment. The findings will help inform the direction and scope for the council's future organisation design and how it works with partners and communities to deliver services in the future. 

The ITAC CLT, part of the broader It Takes a City Initiative that brings the wider community together to address homelessness, is seeking to provide and manage housing, relieve financial hardship and promote regeneration, with an initial focus on small modular housing schemes for rough sleepers: this work, that brings many partners together, requires a sustainable financial platform blending social and commercial finance. 

The research will be delivered in phases. The first phase outlined above will take not more than 4 months, it will be jointly commissioned by Cambridge City Council and ITAC CLT. Based on the outcome and findings in the first phase, a second more detailed phase may be commissioned to understand how to develop funding models and options identified in more detail.

The University operates an MC40 Cyclotron and a neutron beam facility is currently being built. The MC40 Cyclotron can produce the proton beam energies in the range of 3~38 MeV. The proposed system will be
integrated to the Cyclotron and/or the neutron beams for mechanical testing under elevated temperatures, with in-situ irradiation.

The system needs to be interface with the irradiation beams at the University of Birmingham. Thus, it is expected that the system should be mobile and/or adjustable in terms of the positioning.

The system shall be able to operate under different environmental conditions, such as air, vacuum or gaseous.

The system shall enable the testing of flat samples, but the capability of testing samples of other geometries (such as cylindrical) is highly desirable.

The system shall be able to accurately measure and control the temperate of the testing sample. The maximum testing sample temperature equal to, or greater than, 1200 oC is needed. The capability of testing at temperatures lower than the
ambient temperature is a plus.

The system shall be able to accurately measure and control the displacement/strain on the testing sample. The capability of remote strain measurement such as digital image correlation is highly desirable.

The system shall be able to provide the maximum load of 5 kN or above. It is highly desirable to have exchangeable load-cells with different maximum loads. The system shall have a digital control system to deliver custom deformation waveforms (e.g. static loading, creep, fatigue including TMF etc), as well as cooled (using
liquid nitrogen/water) grips for temperature control (essential for samples subjected to high beam currents).",,"B15 2TT",,"38000000 ","Kseniya Samsonik",k.samsonik@bham.ac.uk,"University of Birmingham",,BIRMINGHAM,B152TT,England,,,,,,01/07/2022,31/03/2023,19/04/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,298862.46,,27/06/2022,298862.46,"[Cormet Oy|Koivulehdontie 4

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement 

The Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy wish to appoint a supplier to conduct research comparing the regulatory infrastructure in different countries to provide essential measurement metrics for OPSS's design of future border activities to deliver on the Government's strategy of ""To have the world's most effective border that creates prosperity and enhances security for a global United Kingdom"". MS Systems will use the information to re-evaluate current delivery, make changes to the infrastructure and implement measurement metrics.

The work may also have longer term benefits of increasing our awareness of regulatory systems and approaches with key trading partners benefiting our international delivery, supporting trade negotiations and facilitating increased communication with border regulators. 

There are possible benefits to our new OPSS border team as well as they seek to develop experience of the UK border currently only regulated by trading standards. Having an international perspective and better understanding the challenges for UK exporters compared to UK importers will give our staff a perspective that may enable them to engage on a more equal level with local TSOs rather than in full learning mode.

The research project will review literature and conduct interviews with Stakeholders and Experts in Five-Eyes Countries (Australia, Canada, United States of America, New Zealand), and China to understand:

a) The magnitude, methodology, reporting and measurement of effectiveness of border interventions.
b) To understand how interventions are valued and measured.

A precise list of questions to be answered by the research is included in the tender documentation. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the ITQ document.

The dilution refrigerator will be appropriate for cooling a two-component payload, consisting of (i) An electromagnetic resonator, such as a conducting-wall resonant cavity; and (ii) Ultra-low-noise readout electronics in as close proximity as possible to the resonator, allowing them to be coupled together. The space for the electromagnetic resonator should be threaded by a static magnetic field of nominal magnitude 8T, The ultra-low-noise readout electronics should be in a magnetic-field-free region, with magnetic field exclusion achieved via a combination of a field compensation coil and passive normal-conducting and superconducting shields mounted in the bore of the compensation coil. The operating base temperature of the refrigerator should be not more than 10mK at the mixing chamber plate, where the cooling power should be at least 12 microwatts at 20mK and at least 400 microwatts at 100mK. The experiment will run cold and at with the magnetic field threading the cavity for at least 6 months at a time without need to be warmed up. The refrigerator should utilize mechanical pre-cooling to a sufficiently low temperature for the dilution refrigerator to operate, so that the only liquid cryogens that are required are the helium3/helium4 mixture in the closed cycle dilution refrigerator unit and some liquid nitrogen that may be required for a cold trap in the gas handling unit. The system should incorporate its own reliable control system and software for ease of control, and this control system should also be remotely operable from the data acquisition system of the experiment, via an appropriate cable interface. A schedule of tests required to demonstrate function upon delivery of the apparatus are supplied in the technical specification.

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer. All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

Brief
The Office of Manpower Economics provides an independent secretariat to eight Pay Review Bodies. X-Factor is a pensionable addition to basic military pay intended to reflect the net disadvantage in conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces compared with civilians. The level of X-Factor is typically reviewed every five years and this is the focus of this research project. 

Overall aims of this research
•	To inform the AFPRB's review of the level of X-Factor in 2022, ahead of its forthcoming report, to be published in 2023. 
•	To provide an assessment of the X-Factor components as they relate to the civilian sector. 

Objectives of the procurement 
•	Identify and provide time-series data and analysis for the civilian sector relating to each of the X-Factor components as set out in the 2021 review (not yet published). 
•	Identify credible alternative data sources as a contingency in case those used previously are no longer available/out of date. 
•	Regarding the tapering of X-Factor for senior ranks, the project should ascertain whether the components vary by seniority within civilian life. Of particular interest are senior managers at an equivalent level to armed forces senior ranks.
•	Data to cover the period from 2018-22 (or latest available data depending on the source. This may require that the report be updated if new data is released).   
•	Provide the OME with an analysis of the data, as they relate to the civilian sector, an assessment of how they have changed since 2017, and an assessment of which components are the most highly valued in the civilian sector. 
•	Provide the OME with an assessment of which of these data sources are likely to be available for use in future reviews of the level of X-Factor.

The children and young people experiencing suicidal ideation and self- harm often do not meet threshold for specialised interventions offered through CAMHS and NELFT. Lack of information about services available to children demonstrating suicidal ideation is also a key factor in cases, which can lead to a crisis situation.
Kent County Council are looking to commission organisation(s) to provide a choice of wellbeing and emotional resilience courses and one to one support, tailored to the needs of the children and parents in Kent. 
The programme should employ Cognitive Behaviour Coaching to explore mental health issues including eating disorders, sleep hygiene, body image, self-harm and suicidal idealisation, and isolation. The programme should provide tailored support to help build resilience, and provide sustainable solutions, so that children and young people are better equipped to meet the demands and challenges of life. 
We are expecting the project to cover: 
-	Confidence and self-esteem including positive body image
-	Self-respect and respecting others
-	Coping with change or transition
-	How to initiate and sustain satisfying personal relationships
-	Coping strategies to improve relaxation and reduce stress or anger
-	Understanding stress, depression and anger and recognising personal 'triggers' 
-	Exploring options such as personal support networks and where to find help in the wider community 
-	Developing coping strategies to maintain wellbeing and to recover from ill mental health 
-	Emotional Literacy principles
Successful organisation(s) will deliver two intervention models 
1)	A small group course which will run for six weeks of 1-hour sessions to help children and young people to manage their mental health issues and build greater emotional resilience and wellbeing. This will be followed up with a 1-2-1 session to develop an individualised plan to address any remaining needs that may require ongoing support.
2)	1-2-1 personalised (up to) hour-long sessions, for six - eight weeks. These will be follow up focused 121 session to develop an individualised moving on plan and to address any remaining needs that may require ongoing support.",,,"South East","85323000 ","Sam Wright",sam.wright@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,27/06/2022,31/10/2022,10/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,167828,,26/06/2022,167828,"[Imago Community|John Spare House

This situation is on top of many years of constrained local authority budgets and care provider cost increases, such as those due to the National Living Wage and broader inflation. The purchase of Valuing Care's data is critical to our ability to understand whether local authorities are paying sustainable fees.
The scale of these risks and the importance of mitigating them is reflected in their inclusion on the Departmental level risk register and that whilst significant risk remains to the market, this complicates the Department's ambitions for reform.
The Department is responsible for national stewardship of adult social care markets. In response to the risks identified above, DHSC has designed a significant programme to oversee care markets, mitigate the risks to the availability of affordable, high quality adult social care, and to ensure markets at the front line are able to meet the needs of the population for care and support over the short, medium and longer term.

A key part of market monitoring conducted by analysts at the department is a comparison of the fees that LAs pay with measures of the true cost to run a care home or domiciliary care business, appropriately adjusted for local circumstances.  

Access to this data intelligence and analysis is essential to ensuring the Department gains and maintains an up-to-date, objective, comprehensive and accurate understanding of current state of, and trends in, the ASC market.",,"SW1H 0EU",England,"72300000 ","Joyce Angoma",joyce.angoma@dhsc.gov.uk,"The abovementioned address",,London,"SW1H 0EU","United Kingdom",,,,"https://atamis-1928.cloudforce.com/sfc/p/0O000000rwim/a/8d000000IieM/_Zo70FQsGCIWvMWrnrGXa2ToqbSreq3h6y.OyXZVtk4 ",,01/07/2022,30/06/2023,28/06/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,11724,11724,29/06/2022,11724,"[VALUING CARE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT LTD|Cairns House,

\r
This work will replicate key themes of a previous piece of work that DCC commissioned in 2021 for and jointly with East Devon District Council - A Clean Growth Vision for Development in East Devon, but will be tailored to the specific needs and opportunities related to Teignbridge.\r
\r
The key aims of this work are to provide a source of evidence for Teignbridge and DCC planners and Economic Development practitioners to shape and design relevant interventions and capture strategic, business, economic and skills opportunities around the clean growth agenda, in line with the move towards net zero, developments in the wider global, national, regional and local business landscape and in line with current and emerging UK Government, regional and local policy.\r
\r
A supporting aim of this work is to produce a short summary shaped as a prospectus to business and Government, highlighting the clean growth opportunities within Teignbridge and the surrounding area where relevant, encouraging investment that will enable Teignbridge and its partners to realise opportunities and their ambitions in this field.\r
\r
Current intentions are to procure this work for the Teignbridge area and use budgets from and related to Teignbridge matched to the DCC contribution, but ensure that this work notes strategic links to areas outside of the Teignbridge boundary. Discussions are currently taking place with other partner councils as to whether there is willingness to extend this work to include other areas outside of the Teignbridge boundary, although given discussions to date it is currently expected that this work will only relate to Teignbridge. Should an extension of scope happen then the budgetary amount may increase and the title of the work will change to incorporate other geographies. A total budget of up to £40,000 has been mooted for this piece of work currently for Teignbridge, but with the expectation that a final procurement may come in slightly under the full amount.",,,England,"79311400 ","Louise Baker",louise.k.baker@devon.gov.uk,"County Hall","Topsham Road",Exeter,"EX2 4QD","United Kingdom","'+44 1392383000",http://www.devon.gov.uk,,,,20/07/2022,01/02/2023,07/06/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,40000,40000,28/06/2022,40000,"[City Science Corporation Limited|EX2 4AN|NONE||Yes|No]",,20/07/2022,01/02/2023,"Open ",,12:00

As the appointed contractor, UKAD is responsible for the management of the doping control process during the Games including the collection, transportation, and analysis of samples, as required by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). In carrying out the sample collection process, UKAD must comply with the Chain of Custody requirements set out in the WADA International Standard for Testing and Investigations (ISTI).

Launching a digital collections platform is a critical aspect of The Ruskin's mission to open the collection to a wider audience than ever before, locally and globally. The digital collections platform falls under The Ruskin's wider Digital Strategy, which we have accelerated in response to both the Covid-19 pandemic; and because in 2021, The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection was removed to storage while the museum building is redeveloped. The Digital Strategy includes our aim to digitally re-connect Ruskin collections worldwide, working with existing partners at the Yale Center for British Art and The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in the USA, and Birmingham Museums & Galleries, and the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Manchester in the UK, amongst others. The digital collections platform is an enabling step toward that ambition.  
      
      While the collection will remain underground until 2023, continued public access will be facilitated through partner exhibitions, digital and public programmes. All activity, including the digital collections platform, should meet the needs of existing users and create opportunities for audience development amongst key user groups, who represent a variety of interest and knowledge levels. These include:  
      
      General Publics: both the curious, looking for collection engagement without a specific outcome in mind, through browsing and discovery; and who know what they are looking for;  
      
      Families: adults with early years and primary-age children, looking for immersive and playful experiences that capitalise on Ruskin's intensely visual story-worlds;  
      
      Teaching/Learning: including home education, schools, colleges and HE, looking for content to enhance the national or place-based curricula, and/or course development;   
      
      Special Interest Groups: ranging from climate change activists, to Lakeland local history, looking to engage thematically cross-collection;  
      
      Specialist Researchers: including scholars of Ruskin and nineteenth-century literature, culture and science; interdisciplinary researchers; curators. 
      
      The digital collections platform should, through functionality and design, engage and empower publics and researchers (including the optimisation of the research potential of the collection via practices and tools compliant with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)); facilitate both wide-ranging and deep engagement with the collection; and communicate its contemporary relevance.",,"LA1 4YW","North West","48000000 ","Angela Wearden",a.wearden@lancaster.ac.uk,Lancaster,Lancaster,Lancaster,"LA1 4YW","United Kingdom","01524 594087",,,,,18/04/2022,17/04/2025,13/03/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,100000,125000,24/06/2022,0,"[Knowledge Integration Ltd|35 Paradise Street, Sheffield, United Kingdom, S3 8PZ|NONE||No|No]",,18/04/2022,17/04/2025,"Open ",,17:04
