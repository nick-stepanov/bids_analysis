This is part of the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy programme.

The Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy programme is a government programme aimed to support the build of gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure in the areas of the UK which are unlikely to attract commercial investment for gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, referred to as the final 20% (f20). Building Digital UK (BDUK, part of DCMS) will be targeting its market intervention in these areas of the UK via this subsidy award programme, to subsidise the build of gigabit-capable networks providing long-term, sustainable availability of wholesale gigabit broadband services in the hardest to reach parts of the UK. The Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy programme builds on the success of existing programmes being delivered by BDUK to deliver gigabit-capable networks across the UK. It is envisaged this programme will last for up to 9 years and award contracts throughout that period.

The city, which began preparing its bid in June, received praise for its world-class facilities including the M and S Bank Arena and ACC Liverpool, the innovation behind its cultural programme, the plans to celebrate Ukrainian people and community and the walkability; of the city.

Liverpools unrivalled reputation for staging large-scale cultural events played a key part in the decision-making process as did the citys relationship with its sister city Odesa.

The city region-wide support for Liverpools bid also proved to be a hit with the judges, and the Team Liverpool approach was noted as residents, visitors, organisations and community groups across the city got behind the bid.

Liverpools Eurovision team will now start to put their plans into action, which includes working with Ukrainian street artists and fashion designers, creating a Liverpool/Ukraine community education programme and developing plans to host a special culture trail featuring Eurovision and scouse legend Sonia.
As part of the event plan and vision, a Eurovision Village will be created as a live event site open to the public from the 5th May until 13th May (dates tbc but will only vary in one or two days). This village will be created on the Pier head site and will consist of activations, stages, live music, concessions and much more. Build and Break dates tbc.
Culture Liverpool are seeking a security and stewarding company to help deliver this village and other associated production elements as required of the Eurovision programme. The appointed company will be working alongside Culture Liverpool, Merseyside Police and the BBC to bring together the security plan for the Village, alongside other elements of the Eurovision programme.

To do this, it is expected that resources and training will need to meet a variety of learning needs, learning styles and access requirements and be accessible through a single point of access.

Background 

Across the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and associated agencies there is work exploring the potential use of REM on fishing vessels as it is an important 
tool for improving monitoring of fishing activity.

There is now a need to undertake a piece of work to look at how data collected under different potential applications of REM could be integrated and used most efficiently by those who need the data. This project will focus on working with key stakeholders (data teams, statisticians, policy teams, fisheries management and compliance teams, data hub providers) within the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), Defra and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and

Due to the diversity of the interventions across the Agency's programmes, and their different maturities, the exercise has been performed at a programme level.\r
\r
The objective has been to highlight the most probable and significant consequences for programmes and apply judgement to produce a directional view of the potential impact on performance. The Agency does not currently have the capability to perform more sophisticated bottom-up modelling, and there is always a risk of spurious accuracy, given the range of factors at play.\r

The training will enable officers to achieve an industry recognised certification and also will enable the delegate to apply for professional registration to the institute at Tech CIWEM grade.

It was designated in 2016 as part of Tranche 2 of the MCZ designation process under the Marine and Coastal Access Act (MCAA) 2009. 

The MCZ was designated for nine chalk, rock, and sedimentary habitats, and one geological feature. The conservation objectives for those features were set as 'maintain in favourable condition' based on best available evidence at the time.

Subtidal chalk is a geomorphological feature comprising exposed chalk beds and outcrops. This feature is of significance because of the reef habitat the outcrops provide, and the associated communities that are attracted by the rocky substrate. 

As part of NEs ongoing work at the site we are looking to obtain further understanding of the ecological reliance on the subtidal chalk feature. Attributes of the subtidal chalk feature at CSCB MCZ relevant to this work are listed below:
•	Physical structure of rocky substrate
•	presence and spatial distribution of biological communities,
•	species composition of component communities, and
•	non-native species and pathogens.

This RFQ is for the analysis of seabed imagery from a nearshore survey undertaken by Eastern IFCA during the summer of 2022 within the CSCB MCZ.

The location is exposed to the unforgiving North Sea weather and as such is constantly subject to the elements. The site has been highlighted to be refurbished with drainage, contouring and the rope edging to be specific issues being considered. The refurbishment project has been allocated a £48K budget with the aim of being completed by spring 2023. The project wishes to encourage creativity and inspiration in the design but would favourably consider designs that encompass all points highlighted in the project outline.  The project outline is meant to be a guide for the specialist companies to allow proposals to be submitted without stifling creative inspiration. The submitted proposals will be presented to Filey Town Council for consideration with the aim to begin the refurbishment immediately after the end of the summer season. Construction in winter will be a challenge due to the inclement weather however by maximising the window for refurbishment there should be periods of dry weather to complete the project.

This requires work to be undertaken to identify feasible locations to implement both micro ""20-minute neighbourhood"" projects (such as community gardens and edible bus stops) and a full-scale pilot scheme for the model.
The aim behind the idea of 20-minute neighbourhoods (20MNs) is to create walkable, liveable environments that are attractive, interesting, and safe in which people of all ages and various levels of fitness can travel actively for short distances from home to the destinations and services they need to use day-to-day. This includes access to shopping, recreation and leisure activities, schools, and local services such as GP surgeries. People may then work at or near home or work more in local businesses or hubs and travel to work beyond their neighbourhood is made easier through high-quality public transport and active travel connections. In this way, inclusive and intergenerational communities are supported. 
There are multiple economic, environmental, health and social benefits to 20MNs, which include for example: supporting local businesses through community wealth building; addressing climate change by reducing local emissions; improving access to healthier food; and tackling health inequalities through increasing physical activity levels and better mental health.",,"BN7 1UE",,"71313000 ","Orbis Procurement",OrbisSourcingSolutions@eastsussex.gov.uk,"County Hall,St. Annes Crescent",,LEWES,BN71UE,England,,,,,,23/01/2023,30/05/2023,18/11/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,49450,,05/12/2022,49450,"[Troy Hayes Planning Ltd|41-42 Foley Street

Following learning from the 'Everyone In' initiative and the reduction in the numbers of people sleeping rough in Wolverhampton, proposals have been reviewed to move focus towards prevention work. 

Wolverhampton has a history of strong partnership working between organisations that support the rough sleeper cohort. This joined up approach has proven to be very successful and has achieved significant outcomes for people rough sleeping or at risk of rough sleeping in the City. City of Wolverhampton Council and its partners are committed to continuing this work to ensure that no individual feels that they have no choice other than to bed down on the streets, and that anyone who does sleep rough is provided with an immediate response and the appropriate support.

The Rough Sleeper Services contract will be split into three lots as detailed below. The three lots will provide essential services to prevent and relieve rough sleeping for people sleeping rough, people at risk of rough sleeping and people with a history of rough sleeping. Partnership bids that draw on the existing successful partnership working with this cohort and demonstrate added benefits of secure information sharing within the services will be welcomed. If a partnership bid was successful, a lead organisation would be expected to sub-contract other organisations for delivery against specific lots and/or outcomes. Fast mobilisation will be mandatory for all three lots with a start date of 1st January 2023.

This survey will contribute to evidence gathering in year one of the marine Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (mNCEA) inshore benthic project. This is part of a three-year Defra-funded programme, which is led by Natural England and looks to support the drive for new approaches to decision making based on the Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) approach. This means using comprehensive evidence of the benefits provided through marine benthic habitats and species (food, carbon storage, well-being etc.) to increase confidence, and to reduce time and costs associated with making complex environmental decisions concerning the marine environment. The end product will be a suite of natural capital tools which will be used in decision making.

This survey will gather evidence on the quantity and quality of intertidal ecosystem assets. The work is packaged in two Lots; Lot 1 for the Solway Firth SAC, and Lot 2 for Morecambe Bay SAC. Contractors are invited to apply for either one or both of these lots. The aims, objectives, methods and data output requirements are the same for both Lots.

The evidence gathered in this survey will improve the coverage, scale and quality of ecological evidence (specifically intertidal benthic habitats). Detailed survey and analyses will enable us to understand the distribution and scale provisioning services of the sediments to marine birds, and humans (shellfish). Evidence gathering in year 1 of the mNCEA programme will feed into Natural England's natural capital understanding of not only biodiversity but other ecosystem services.

This project will investigate current best practices and potential impacts of image normalisation in the development of Spring and Autumn satellite mosaic creation used within the Living England workflow for segmentation and habitat classification. The current mosaicking process includes a ""Swiss-cheese"" method for creating cloud-free mosaics, which involves removing any cloudy or shadow pixels and stacking the imagery to create the mosaic. The primary image is taken as the least cloudy image, with any cloud or shadow gaps filled by subsequent images, ordered from least to most cloudy. However, differences in acquisition timing and ground conditions can result in radiometric differences between the stacked images, the impact of which has not been quantified within the Living England process. There is potential that normalising the input imagery prior to mosaicking will result in improvements in the segmentation and aid comparisons of the segmentations derived from different mosaics. This could result in further improvements to how these maps can be used in assessing habitat change in extent over time due to the comparisons of satellite imagery from different seasons and years. The normalising of imagery values may also impact upon the habitat classification process, as these are used to derive zonal statistics within segment objects and are modelled using a random forest classification model. As a result, normalising the imagery within the mosaicking process may impact upon the overall accuracy of the habitat classification process.",,,England,"72212326 72316000 ","Anne Stefaniak",anne.stefaniak@naturalengland.org.uk,"Apex Court, City Link",,Nottingham,"NG2 4LA",England,,,"Specification for normalisation mini-project - LE.pdf ",,"Your response should be returned to the following email address by:

As EY policy continues to develop and the Early Years Education recovery programme is rolled out, there is a clear need from the sector for support from the department as we deliver our key objectives and support with implementing the reforms into their second year.

Continuing to maintain consistent engagement is essential to ensure the reforms are implemented confidently and successfully. We know from sector feedback that for some the reforms have presented challenges, and it is vital that we still have a mechanism to engage with them, ensuring the aims of the reforms are realised.

The Foundation Years website also enables us to share guidance, information, and effective practice on potential forthcoming changes under consultation, such as those on staff to child ratios, supervision requirements while children are eating and potential changes to provide increased support for childminders.

We want to make sure that those helping to deliver the Department for Education policies are fully supported to do so with a long term, sustained commitment through an engagement contract.

The EYFS engagement partner, will provide continued essential support to the sector following the COVID-19 pandemic, and deliver relevant messaging and crucial information about the Early Years Education Recovery programme.

As we now look to the future and recovery from COVID-19, it is more important than ever that we are able to continue to work with an engagement partner to support the sector by providing key information and timely communication regarding both EYFS policy / implementation and the COVID-19 recovery programme.

We use third party venues as we don't have the facilities to host ourselves in our owned spaces. It is important for us to host in person events so ensure we bring colleagues from across all locations in the UK together, face to face, so that they can feel connected and collaborate with their colleagues on a regular basis. 

We required venues of varying sizes - from all staff conferences and overnight events, to smaller away days or team events. Our events are primarily hosted in London, or the surrounding areas, however we would potentially host across the UK if required.

NS&I require our provider to be flexible when working together to source the venue. We don't always know exact requirements of the day at the start of the process for each event and like to be open minded, as the perfect venue might help shape our plan for the day. We therefore need our supplier to be able to support us in providing a personalised service, with an account manager that we can reach through telephone and email, to assist with tailored booking requirements and service.

Based on previous years, we estimated that approximately 130-140 level access showers and 10 shower over baths may be ordered per year, however this will fluctuate based on client requirements. It is estimated that each contractor will receive orders for approximately 20-25 level access showers and 1-2 shower over baths per annum.

The tender was not divided into geographical lots. 

The Framework go-live date is 1st December 2022. The Framework Agreement will run for a period of two years with two 12 month options to extend thereafter (2+1+1 years - total possible duration of 4 years) subject to the agreement of both parties and contractual performance.

The value of the Framework for the four year term is estimated to be in the region of £2.26m excluding VAT. The estimate is forecast on the basis of historical data and anticipated future demand. The total value of projects which may be procured under the Framework cannot be guaranteed.",,,"North West","45000000 ","Emma Tweedie",Emma.Tweedie@oldham.gov.uk,"Oldham Council - Civic Centre","West Street",OLDHAM,OL11UT,England,,,,,,01/12/2022,30/11/2024,25/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,2260000,,30/11/2022,2260000,"[M & R Heating Ltd|Unit A8 Axis Point, Hill Top Road, Heywood, England, OL10 2RQ|COMPANIES_HOUSE|6668470|Yes|No][Structec (NW) Ltd|Windsor House, North Mersey Business Centre,

BACKGROUND

Staff surveys are used to identify and understand the status of employees with regards to their motivation, commitment, performance, and other key areas such as leadership, diversity and inclusion as well as their personal and professional development.

We are committed to supporting positive outcomes through understanding the assets and needs of our children looked after and care leaver population, including current provision and identifying measures that need to be put in place to ensure that there is an appropriate range of provision to meet future projected need.

In our commitment of permanence and our ambition to find the right placement for children looked after we aim to reduce the number of placements out of the borough and in residential care. We strongly believe that family-based care in the child or young person's community is usually the right option for them, whether that is with a special guardian, foster carers, or connected person/people and ultimately improves outcomes for our children and young people.

We will meet placement sufficiency needs by promoting family-based care wherever possible to meet the needs of the Wigan children looked after profile and our vision for children and young people in the Borough.

The fostering service main responsibilities are:

• Recruitment of Foster Carers
• Assessment and Support of Family and Friends Foster Carers

• Attracting and retaining Foster Carers

Regarding any new evidence we would expect the consultant to discuss the scope the ORR project lead. The first part of the project will focus on the operational capacity and performance evidence needed, which will rely heavily on Network Rail and the applicant's input and expertise. Depending on the results of the operational capacity analysis the consultant may be asked to conduct economic analysis on the applications.The report produced and the assessment undertaken will help inform ORR's decision on which access rights should be approved within the track access applications. ORR is likely to cite this analysis in explaining the reasons for its final decisions. Therefore, the assessment must follow best practice, to ensure it is robust, impartial, consistent, and transparent in its treatment of each of the service options. The assessment must also differentiate between existing and additional services and provide a response on each category as to if and when they can be accommodated. For clarity, we define additional services as those that are additional to the services operating from December 2022 (and included in the current AWC Section 18 application). This will include consideration of the application from WMT for a timebound service and any extension beyond its planned expiry date.This review and analysis of evidence already provided, planned perturbation analysisand any further analysis should not duplicate Network Rail or applicant work (unless necessary).The consultants will be expected to work constructively with both infrastructure manager and operators.",,,"United Kingdom","71311200 79410000 ","Harriet Dinkele",procurementteam@orr.gov.uk,"25 Cabot Square",,London,E144QZ,England,02072823944,,"Bravosolution Joining Instruction for open tender.doc ORR CT 22-45 Disclaimer.doc ORR CT 22-45 Draft Form of Agreement.docx ORR CT 22-45 Form of Tender.doc ORR CT 22-45 - ITT Assessment of Applications for Track Access on the West Coast Mainline.docx ",,"The tender exercise is being managed via the ORR Procurement portal (BRAVO).

This course is also suitable for existing ITS staff in the Business Analyst role who haven't already undertaken this training, supporting continuity across roles.
Where ITS have a full Junior BA programme running a closed course will be required, however where existing staff require the training the number of delegates will not support a closed course therefore the preference is for them to attend a public course.",,"SA6 7JL",Wales,"80500000 ","Elin Foster",Elin.Foster@dvla.gov.uk,"Longview Road",,Swansea,"SA6 7JL",Wales,0,,"Award Letter.pdf Contract Award Form.pdf Specification.pdf ",,,05/12/2022,04/12/2023,30/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,14328,,02/12/2022,14328,"[IRM UK STRATEGIC IT TRAINING LIMITED|Second Floor, PINNER, Middlesex, HA5 5NE, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,05/12/2022,04/12/2023,"SingleTenderActionNonOJEU ",,12:00

"DPS 5863",Contract,"WORCESTER CITY COUNCIL",Awarded,2022-12-01T16:56:08Z,"External Wall Insulation Installer","The overarching objective of the project is to reduce fuel poverty and cut carbon emissions by improving the energy efficiency of the targeted homes, aiming to bring them up to an EPC level C where practical.

This contract is to provide services to the Authority to support delivery of the scheme and to install External Wall Insulation to identified solid wall properties. 

All works and services carried out in conjunction with this contract will be undertaken by a PAS 2030:2019 certified contractor and in compliance with PAS 2035:2019 requirements. 

The aim is to install External Wall Insulation on up to 20 solid wall properties in Worcester City. The 20 EWI is a target and cannot be guaranteed, as it is dependent on the properties which come forward and on the retrofit assessments. The final number of installs may be 
fewer than 20; likewise dependent on demand there may be more than 20.

Across the project, there is an average cost of £10,000 per property so the higher cost of EWI is to be offset with other measures in the remaining properties. 

In addition, the Authority will be applying for additional funding under the Home Upgrade Scheme (HUG). In the event that the Authority is successful in securing further funding, the Authority reserves the right to extend this contract to cover the additional measures at its 
unfettered discretion.

This contract has been awarded initially for a value of up to £400,000 to cover the installations under Sustainable Warmth, which must be completed by 17th March 2023 and all relevant 
documentation submitted to the Authority by 7th April 2023. The actual amount paid to the Contractor will be dependent on the number of properties receiving EWI and the cost per property.

Subject to the Contractor's satisfactory performance, and the Authority successfully being awarded further funding, the Authority may at its unfettered discretion extend the contract to deliver further installations under future energy efficiency schemes until 31st March 2025.",,,"West Midlands","09300000 45215214 45300000 ",,procurement@worcester.gov.uk,Guildhall,,WORCESTER,WR12EY,England,,,,,,05/12/2022,30/04/2023,14/11/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,300460,,01/12/2022,300460,"[COCUUN LTD|Phoenix House,3 South Parade
