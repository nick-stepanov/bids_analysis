Once the scenario modelling is complete, the project will use forecasts resulting from scenario modelling to inform policy options, such as those presented as part of the National Recovery Plan, as well as feasibility studies for individual projects best positioned to address the war-related loss of energy infrastructure. Finally, the insights from these assessments and studies will inform the development of an updated Energy Strategy that will provide guidance for the long-term post-war development of the energy sector aligned with the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement and the Paris Agreement.
Due to the volatility and unpredictability of the situation, the project will be implemented in two distinct phases: 
•	Phase 1 (October 2022 - January 2023) dedicated to the analysis of risks and potential impacts, determination of assumptions, development of scenarios and delivery of theoretical training of the representatives of the Ministry of Energy on data gathering and preparatory work on scenario modelling, as well as the update of the Energy Strategy of Ukraine document (excluding the supporting documentation). 
•	Phase 2 (January - March 2023) is dedicated to the development of the implementation plan and all supporting documents for the updated Energy Strategy of Ukraine, and delivery of the practical training to the representatives of the Ministry of Energy on the operation of the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model generator for the long-term scenario modelling and interpretation of the resulting data.",,,Ukraine,"73000000 ","Zuzanna Pogorzelska",zuzanna.pogorzelska@abtbritain.co.uk,"1 Chamberlain Square",,BIRMINGHAM,SE12RD,England,"'+44 (0)20 3874 3440",,,,,04/10/2022,31/03/2023,25/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,401595,,30/09/2022,401595,"[KPMG Ukraine LTD|32/2, Moskovska St., Kyiv, 01010, Ukraine|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,04/10/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,18:00

The Commissioner needed additional services from the original provider; to continue with this established, innovative provider, who is responsible for the coordination and delivery of all community services, inclusive of all ages, across East Staffordshire. A change of provider could not have been made for economic and technical reasons (given requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing service) at this time, without giving significant inconvenience/added costs which would not be in the patients' interests.

The provider has ensured stability and rigour in the delivery of high quality, sustainable services as they are today, whilst also working to progress towards the Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent ICS vision. The services are a range of core community services (including current in reach community services at HMP Dovegate). These are services for all ages and for all patients registered with one of the 18 GP practices across East Staffordshire.

In the light of the continued effects on the health system of the pandemic subsequent covid outbreaks and the unexpected severity of impact at the time of the modification decision, engagement to develop this service has been delayed. The Commissioners needed to continue with the contract arrangements and will continue to keep this situation under review. It would have been unduly disruptive to the continuity of services for patients and have caused significant inconvenience for the Commissioners to undertake a procurement process at that time.

It was therefore necessary for the contracting authority, to extend the length of the community provision with Midlands Partnership Foundation Trust. The value of the overall contract including this modification during term is £32,082,715.00.

"East Staffordshire Community Services",Contract,"Midlands & Lancashire C S U",Awarded,2023-08-29T14:41:17+01:00,"East Staffordshire Community Services","This notice is being placed to inform the market of a modification to contractual arrangements for East Staffordshire Community Services which took place from October 2022 up to March 2023. The Commissioner needed additional services from the original provider; to continue with this established, innovative provider, who is responsible for the coordination and delivery of all community services, inclusive of all ages, across East Staffordshire. A change of provider could not have been made for economic and technical reasons (given requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing service) at this time, without giving significant inconvenience/added costs which would not be in the patients' interests.

The provider has ensured stability and rigour in the delivery of high quality, sustainable services as they are today, whilst also working to progress towards the Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent ICS vision. The services are a range of core community services (including current in reach community services at HMP Dovegate). These are services for all ages and for all patients registered with one of the 18 GP practices across East Staffordshire.

In the light of the continued effects on the health system of the pandemic subsequent covid outbreaks and the unexpected severity of impact at the time of the modification decision, engagement to develop this service has been delayed. The Commissioners needed to continue with the contract arrangements and will continue to keep this situation under review. It would have been unduly disruptive to the continuity of services for patients and have caused significant inconvenience for the Commissioners to undertake a procurement process at that time.

It was therefore necessary for the contracting authority, to extend the length of the community provision with Midlands Partnership Foundation Trust. The value of the overall contract including this modification during term is £27,499,470.00. The value of this modification itself is £4,583,245.00.",,,"West Midlands","85100000 ","Elizabeth Johnson",elizabeth.johnson1@nhs.net,"Heron House,120 Grove Road",,"STOKE ON TRENT",B709LD,England,"07767 287432",,,,,01/10/2022,31/03/2023,30/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,27499470,,30/09/2022,4583245,"[Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust|MELLOR HOUSE,CORPORATION STREET

NHSE sought to secure Prime Provider(s) who had the capability and capacity to deliver services in line with the specified requirements.

There are 11 establishments across the South West, which were separated in to four lots. A single contract has been awarded to a Prime Provider for each lot.

The Contracts have been awarded for a term of approximately 7 years, with no extension options; all contracts will expire on 30 September 2029. 

1. Bristol, South Gloucestershire and Wiltshire (BSGW) prisons - awarded to Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, and commenced on 01 October 2022:
HMP Bristol (Cat B)
HMP Ashfield (Cat C)
HMP Erlestoke (Cat C)
HMP Leyhill (Cat D)

2. Female closed prison: HMP Eastwood Park - awarded to Practice Plus Group Ltd (PPG), and commenced on 01 October 2022, 

3. Dorset prisons - awarded to Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, and commenced on 01 December 2022: 
HMP Guys Marsh (Cat C)
HMP Portland (Cat C)
HMP The Verne (Cat C)

4. Devon prisons - awarded to Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, and commenced on 01 December 2022:
HMP Exeter (Cat B)
HMP Channings Wood (Cat C)
HMP Dartmoor (Cat C)

Social Care

Provision of social care varies across the prisons. Where social care is not currently part of the delivery model at this stage, for certain prisons, the Commissioner hopes to move to a fully integrated service during the life of the contract, subject to emerging demand at that stage. 

Any updates or changes in relation to social care will be managed through contract variation processes during the life of the contract. 


Dentistry

Dental service provision is within scope and will be delivered via a dental provider operating under a Personal Dental Services (PDS) contract issued by NHSE.

Financial envelopes

The advertised total whole life combined contract value for all lots is £278,377,000.00

This value includes social care values where applicable, mobilisation funding, which will be made available in Year 1, and a ""Provider Improvement Fund"" for Years 2 to 7. This fund will be retained by the Commissioner and aims to enable flexibility of funding for multi-establishment initiatives. The providers will need to work with the Commissioner on an initiative-by-initiative basis to access this funding.",,,"South West","85000000 ","Alexandra Searle",scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"THREE SIX ZERO",,BRISTOL,"BS1 3NX",England,,,,,"Change

There is a national prison expansion programme taking place to increase the number of available places in prison, and it is anticipated that there will be operational capacity changes across the South West prison estate.

The contract envelope is based on current operational capacity figures and the providers will be required to work with commissioners to address any changes that happen.

This, along with other changes resulting from reconfiguration, e.g. flow of people, resettlement and trainer populations, and aging populations, will need to be accounted for in the delivery of healthcare services.

Changes to prison population(s) will be managed through contract variation processes.


This procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioner(s).

The Government Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution2 outlines further commitments to low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear power. Renewable energy, nuclear power station developments, and other Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are all required to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), as well as other statutory assessments, to fulfil environmental regulations and support the consenting process for the projects.
There is currently a lack of guidance on the process to define the geographic scales of populations of fish species in the marine environment, as required for use in EIA, Habitats Regulations Assessments (HRA), and Marine Conservation Zone assessments (MCZa). Establishing standardised process will ensure consistency in approach between projects, robustness for consenting processes, and has the potential to de-risk and streamline the consenting process for developments and regulators.
EIA has traditionally taken an approach of assessing losses of fish in a solely anthropogenic context, comparing losses to fishery management stock units, or fishery landings data. This approach however, is not considered relevant when assessing fish populations as features of MPAs, Estuarine N2K sites (SAC/RAMSAR), or as prey species for protected marine mammals and seabirds. High-quality, standardised assessments will contribute to delivering the 25 Year Environment Plan and achieving Good Environmental Status under the UK Marine Strategy.",,"SW1P 3JR",London,"73100000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,,"https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,03/10/2022,24/03/2023,30/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,0,30/09/2022,48037.5,[||NONE_OTHER||No|No],,03/10/2022,24/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,12:00

The main plank of Westminster's Changing Futures programme is to deliver a Specialist Team for Young Adults (18 - 25-year-olds). A key principle of the programme is that the voice of experts by experience (i.e people with lived experience of multiple disadvantage) is built into the design and delivery of the programme. Furthermore, the experts by experience who supported the development of the bid reported how beneficial it was for them to work with people who had had similar experiences.

The LE TacCIS Innovation, Research Experimentation (IRE) activities aims to conduct programme level research and experimentation to de-risk solution development for a wider Land Domain Communication and Information System (LD CIS) perspective and consider what areas require development to ensure that individual projects remain able to deliver their elements of the Single Information Environment. 

The intent of the LE TacCIS-IRE activities includes technical de-risking of programme themes and addressing themes that cover multiple projects and provides a means of including innovative thought into LE TacCIS.  This activity will support the Networks theme of the IRE activities and in particular Tactical Data Links (TDL). 

Tactical Information exchange has never needed to be more accurate, agile and timely to keep pace with persistent and high tempo changes across the battlespace.  To achieve an efficient and effective tactical outcome in national and international environments, the automated and secure exchange of (near) real-time Situational Awareness, Battlespace Management and Command and Control functions can be fulfilled by Tactical Data Links.  Several varieties of TDLs have been developed, each designed to support a difference domain and/or warfare demand. 

Building on the outputs of Phase 1 TDL study conducted in 2021 (DInfoCom/0125), deliver a more detailed technical study on the technicalities and practical implementation of a TDL network architecture within the Land Domain that can complement current and future LE TacCIS and Land ISTAR capabilities (and other multi domain links).",,,"South East","71241000 ",,pauline.hewish662@mod.gov.uk,"on behalf of D Info Commercial, IDL 1, Blenheim Bldg","Army HQ",Andover,"SP11 8HJ",England,,,"20221021-701551801_0174_Order_Form_Redacted.docx 20221021-701551801_0174_Call-Off_Schedules_Redacted.docx 20221021-701551801_0174_Joint_Schedules_Redacted.docx ",,,24/10/2022,31/03/2023,15/03/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,300725,,03/10/2022,300725,"[Meta Mission Data Limited|Malvern Hills Science Park

NICE is focussing on those areas that provide the greatest benefit to people and patients, thereby continuing to contribute to the priorities of the health and care system.  This includes performance against cancer standards, expansion of virtual ward models, exploiting the potential of digital technologies to transform the delivery of care and patient outcomes and making the most effective use of NHS resources by following the evidence base behind these innovations.  NICE needs support to transform our business units and their processes so that we make best use of the resources we have.

We require an organisation wide stakeholder (internal and external) engagement and communications plan that includes:
•	defining the key change message and key messages for different audiences
•	an organisation wide transformation communications plan
•	stakeholder map and matrix - power/influence
•	stakeholder engagement plan including messages, medium and accountability
•	organising, hosting and facilitating communications events both internal and external
•	user insight feedback mechanisms
•	processes for agreement and cascade of transformation communications messages
•	gap analysis and skills transfer plan for a cohort of staff deployed on transformation demonstrator projects

The transformation communication and stakeholder engagement plan align to and work with:
•	NICE's business as usual (BAU) communications activities
•	other organisational processes and practices, including those for strategy and policy development, business planning, finance, performance reporting, capability and capacity management, enterprise risk management, and communications
•	Alignment with government functional standards

The successful supplier should have/be: 
*  Significant experience of designing and successfully establishing whole organisation communications and stakeholder engagement activities.
* Significant experience of working at Board and Executive Team level
* Professional change practitioner with relevant qualifications or other equivalent experience or qualification
* Significant experience of working within a regulated public sector organisation/s
* Understanding of the NHS and the stakeholders within it that NICE's Guidance is for and how they would use it.
* Highly developed interpersonal, negotiation and facilitation experience
* Able to work at pace and deliver to tight deadlines.

A crucial part of our work is hazard assessment of industrial and consumer chemicals, and the correct assignment of bioaccumulation potential is a fundamental component of such assessments.

Currently, there are no validated test guidelines or methods to screen for chemicals that preferentially bioaccumulate in non-lipid rich tissues (e.g. muscle, liver, serums). This project aims to identify what alternative tests are available or could be developed and used to screen for this form of bioaccumulation as a regulatory requirement under UK REACH; specifically in relation to Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic and very Persistent very Bioaccumulative (henceforth PBT) assessment and exposure modelling. 

If suitable methods can be identified, we would like to understand how they would trigger the determination of BioConcentration Factors (BCF;or other bioaccumulation metrics) in aquatic and dietary exposure studies. For example, can equivalent threshold metrics, e.g.:
•	Log KOW > 4.5 be established for screening for a high potential for bioaccumulation in an aquatic organism
•	Log KOW > 2 (in combination with a log KOA¬ > 5) be established for a high potential for bioaccumulation in air-breathing organisms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this project is to provide relevant up-to-date evidence and understanding on the types of study that could inform non-standard accumulation processes in aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.

Cefas and JNCC undertook a survey of West of Wight Barfleur MCZ (WWBF hereafter) between 22nd and 25th January 2021, cruise code CEND0121.

The aim of the survey was to collect data from WWBF to inform assessment of the condition of the feature attributes (i.e. extent, distribution, structure and function, and supporting processes) of the designated features (broadscale sedimentary habitats). 

Video observations were made with a drop camera (DC) system. The DC was equipped with a high-definition video camera and a separate still image camera unit, in a planar (downwards facing) orientation inside the frame. The stills camera was fitted with a two-spot (green) laser-scaling device with laser points set 220mm apart.

100m length DC transects were carried out at 40 sampling locations based on regular triangular grid (including increased replication transects at a subset of six sampling stations). 

Images from each transect have been pre-selected at random to provide a calculated field of view from ~14m2 to ~24m2 per transect. 1303 images have been selected in total for analysis from WWBF.

A further 522 still images acquired at the pinnacles within Haig Fras (HGFR) SAC have also been included for this analysis contract. These were also captured with the same DC system during the earlier 2019 CEND0719 Survey. These images are still subject to final filtering and so the number may reduce, tenderers should provide quotes accounting for a maximum of 522 still images from this survey.",,,"Any region","79311300 ",,procure@cefas.co.uk,"Pakefield Road",,Lowestoft,"NR33 0HT",England,,www.cefas.co.uk,"CEFAS22-87 Cefas_Short_Form_Contract - Seastar Survey Ltd - signed_Redacted.pdf ",,,03/10/2022,28/02/2023,22/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,36990,,03/10/2022,36990,"[Seastar Surevy Ltd|Ocean Quay, Southampton, HAMPSHIRE, SO14 5QY, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,03/10/2022,28/02/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

Language is clearly a major vehicle for learning and critical to children's mental, social, emotional and intellectual development (Communication Trust, 2010). If SLC needs are not tackled in the early years, these issues can become increasingly difficult to address and are strongly linked in later life with mental illness, unemployment, relationship breakdowns, and offending.

It is a whole-body approach to learning, recognising that body language, gesture, facial expression, eye contact, sounds, humour and words are all part of communication and that children learn best when they're in a positive state of mind.

      The first project is for six units of high-level supported accommodation that will form part of the local rough sleeper pathway. This pathway will contribute to ending rough sleeping in Stafford by 2025 and increase the housing options available to individuals with multiple and complex needs who are rough sleeping, or at risk of rough sleeping. 
      
      The overall aim of the project is to get individuals with a history of rough sleeping or repeat homelessness into sustainable accommodation, with tailored support that addresses underlying needs. The approach will provide strength-based solutions and ongoing support so that no one has to spend a night on our streets 
      and instances of rough sleeping and repeat homelessness will be reduced.
      
      The second project is a coproduction model that will engage the voices of those with lived experience, involving the hardest to reach rough sleepers so their views and experiences become an integral element in developing services for people.

It is considered that this Contract can be placed on a Single Source basis with RBSL for Technical Reasons. The FNA is a safety critical internal component of the L30A1 CR2 gun that requires a key modification to the design to include a mechanical fail-safe. This modification is a safety requirement that must be fulfilled to ensure the safe functioning of the platform whilst operational.

RBSL are the Design Authority (DA) and the Original Equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the platform and therefore have all the necessary tools, skills and specialist knowledge to undertake the Firing Needle Assembly (FNA) modification to the required technical manufacturing standards.

Some CR2 platforms have recently experienced some cracking faults on the FNA which have not been seen previously; the ability to out inspect the modified FNA to the current repair specifications is paramount in the safety assurance for the LFNA.

This notice is not a request for expressions of interest so please do not apply to be invited to tender. This notice advises that the Authority has decided to negotiate a contract with the named supplier on a single source basis and is published for reasons of transparency. If you are interested in becoming a sub-contractor for this requirement, you should apply directly to the supplier named above.
