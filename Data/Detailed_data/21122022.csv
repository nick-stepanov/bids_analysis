At the regional level, the recovery planning support will be organised in Kyiv City as well as the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, which were heavily affected by the war. The Project methodology will integrate community needs' assessments; gender equality and social inclusion; conflict sensitivity and environmental impact assessments into the advisory and capacity-building activities. 
The key output of the project is the effective identification, analysis and reporting of community reconstruction priorities which are collected from the ground up and are included in the recovery planning and resource mobilisation by local, regional and national governments in Ukraine. The project technical assistance will align with central and local governance decision making, oblasts and hromadas' governance processes to ensure that the recovery plans are locally-owned and increase transparency and accountability. Ultimately, the citizens will have a greater voice and stake in recovery planning in their areas which aligns with political devolution in Ukraine and helps strengthen the social contract and empowerment of local communities through the decentralisation reform.
The project will deliver (i) analytical support to the Ministry (MCTD), including tools for strategic planning and support the development of the regional and local Recovery Plans; (ii) draft Framework for Regional Recovery Plans in select Oblast State Administrations based on a needs assessment in the regions and information collected; (iii) capacity building and training of hromadas and regional authorities in developing the recovery plans; (iv) diagnostic report on absorption capacity gaps and concept notes on addressing legal and educational bottlenecks.",,,Ukraine,"73000000 ","Zuzanna Pogorzelska",zuzanna.pogorzelska@abtbritain.co.uk,"1 Chamberlain Square",,BIRMINGHAM,SE12RD,England,"'+44 (0)20 3874 3440",,,,,23/12/2022,31/03/2023,15/12/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,683302,,20/12/2022,683302,"[Centre for Economic Strategy (CES)|36D Saksaganskoho street, Kyiv, Ukraine, 02000|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No][Attorneys Association PricewaterhouseCoopers Legal|75 Zhylyanska str, Kyiv, 01032, Ukraine|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,23/12/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,18:00

Without specialist intervention, many are unable to overcome barriers to recovery and employment. Individuals are often unwilling to disclose their dependency to Jobcentre Plus (JCP) Work Coaches due to denial, shame, or fear that they will be sanctioned in some way. Other individuals with a dependency may not be engaged with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (the Buyer) at all. As a result, individuals are not able to receive the help and support they need to overcome the addiction and move towards or into work. The Buyer sought to run a new Peer Mentoring Trial, with Peer Mentors using their lived experience of addiction and recovery to inspire, motivate and support others to manage their dependency, access appropriate support (including treatment, Universal Credit, housing services) and move towards employment. All interested Suppliers needed to be accredited on DWP&apos;s Test and Learn Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) under the Peer Support service line: - DWP Test and Learn DPS: how to register and apply - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk); DWP Test and Learn Dynamic Purchasing System: guidance for businesses - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).

Due to the scale and complexity of these initiatives, the University often requires access to expertise at various points to supplement internal capability. 

The University recognises that some initiatives require significant behavioural change and thus need more emergent strategies alongside robust governance.  

The variety of initiatives in the Open University's change portfolio means that each may have different support needs at various points. Those needs cannot always be met internally or through individual contractors. A framework with a group of consultancy partners able to provide expertise across the breadth of our requirements will bolster the Open University's inhouse capabilities and enable the University to respond fully to those varying needs. 

The Open University intends to contract up to 5 providers to service projects on a call-off basis.

Service Scope of the Framework:  
Project and programme initiation and setup; 
Project and programme delivery; 
Project and programme rescue and recovery; 
Visioning and future state design; Governance; 
Business case development; 
Requirements gathering and management; 
Options Appraisal; Planning including identification and management of critical path; 
PMO set up and operation; 
Project and programme controls including risk, issues and dependencies identification and management, quality and change control; 
Progress monitoring, reporting and evaluation; 
Communications and stakeholder management;
Benefits management; 
Agile delivery; 
Resource and budget management; 
Health checks;
Transition planning and management; 
Change management including change readiness assessments, change impact mapping and analysis and supporting organisation to adapt and adopt to business transformation; 
Behavioural change; 
Organisation, service, and process design; 
Culture change;

C97581,Contract,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT",Awarded,2023-02-08T11:10:12Z,"Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Services to HMP High Down - NHS England","NHS England (the Commissioner) sought to commission Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Services to HMP High Down. Adverts were placed on Contracts Finder and the Find a Tender Service and an Invitation to Tender (ITT) process, based on the Open procedure, was undertaken late summer / autumn 2022 to identify the Most Economically Advantageous Tender and therefore determine the incoming provider.  

HMP High Down has recently changed its role, moving from being a Category B local prison to a Category C resettlement and training prison.

As part of this change, the self-contained health care unit is being decommissioned and will be developed into a self-contained Psychologically Informed Planned Environment (PIPE) unit. 

The Services delivered will consist of two elements:

The use of the self-contained unit will form the first element of the service and will be based on a Progression PIPE model. The intended target group are men who have mild to moderate learning disabilities and who have completed treatment elsewhere. This service will also focus on providing additional support to men transitioning into and out of the unit. 

This will be the first unit of its type in the Category C prison estate working specifically with men who have a mild to moderate learning disability within a PIPE environment. There will be 23 spaces on the unit and the service will be open to men who have committed all offence types. It will be a national resource, with most referrals likely to be from other sites.

The second element of the service is a wider, non-residential, service for men who meet the criteria for an OPD service within HMP High Down. This service will serve both PCoSO (Person Convicted of Sexual Offences) and non-PCoSO populations. 

This intervention service is designed to support the outcomes of the Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Pathway by providing services that deliver individually tailored and psychologically informed interventions directly to people screened onto the pathway, which aims to enhance the management of risk of serious harm to others and re-offending, and develop psychological wellbeing and social engagement. 

The service will be delivered by a joint approach between the health service provider and HMPPS. 

The contract has been awarded to Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust. The contract term will be for 7 years, with a total contract value of Â£4,040,000. This value is inclusive of mobilisation funding which will be available in year 1 and relates to the provision provided by the health service provider only. Separate funding has been made available to support the HMPPS element of service delivery at HMP High Down.    

The contract is due to commence on 1st April 2023.  

This procurement has been carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.

The utilisation of static hydrophones installed on the seabed provides data for individual points throughout the deployment period, which can cover several tidal cycles, including neaps and springs. In addition to generic challenges, for standalone subsea sensors, i.e. power supply, data storage, station keeping at high flow sites and recovery, another challenge unique to subsea noise 
quantification is the flow noise, i.e. noise generated by the flow interference and hydrophone head and frame.

MEECE aspires to measure the underwater background noise at prospective tidal energy development sites and also existing tidal turbines in the Milford Haven waterway and Welsh coastal waters with hydrophones held in a bespoke frame fixing the hydrophone head at a minimum of 1m above the seabed for continuous measurements over 30 days periods.

Architectural Services are required so that the feasibility can be fully scoped / defined for costing purposes as current information is limited.
As the project is being funded by OfS, there are strict deadlines for drawdown.  The brief for the OfS bid was scant and needs development by an architect with experience of Healthcare and this type of specialist facility.  To meet the OfS deadlines the brief needs to be fully developed prior to other consultants coming on board.  Work needs to commence early January 2023 on this aspect of work.  The proposal is to use LSI from the UEA Consultant Framework (PURCON 776) who are one of the UK's leading Architects for Healthcare facilities and have experience of mortuary projects at Southend University hospital, NNUH and Cambridge University hospital.

LSI are the only Architectural Consultant on the Universities Consultant Framework with Health Expertise, this is in addition to being renowned for their work within the healthcare field, being active on NHS framework projects throughout the UK. 
It is important for the Anatomy suite to be fit for purpose and with their extensive knowledge of the healthcare field and bespoke units LSI are best placed to provide the University with the service that it requires in the short funding timescale required.

      Reference:  SBS/10091
      
      Background:
      The vision of NHS PS and the Clinical Care Commissioning Group is to construct two new purpose-built health care facilities in King's Lynn and Rackheath in Norfolk. The King's Lynn site will have a combined net area of 1574m2 constructed on Nar Ouse Way in the regeneration area. The Rackheath site will have a net internal area of 1586m2 and will be constructed alongside an extra care facility and residential homes off Broad Lane. The buildings are required to meet the BREEAM excellent and Net Zero standards. There is also a requirement to demonstrate how the contractor will add social value to the local community during the construction process and following completion. 
      
      Due to time constraints NHS PS have recommended that a Modern Method of Construction (MMC) approach is the viable solution to enable an accelerated delivery of both health facilities. The solution requires the contractor to provide a turnkey solution, including undertaking any surveys and investigations, and appointing the required project team including all designers and sub-contractors, planning consultants required to deliver the schemes. 
      
      Two-Stage Tendering. The first stage will be a Pre-Construction Services Agreement to work with NHS PS, tenants and commissioners to develop the building design to a point where fixed price proposals can be tabled. The second stage will comprise the construction of the facility for the fixed price established during Stage 1.",,,"East of England","44211100 45210000 71220000 ","Abdullah Omer",abdullah.omer@property.nhs.uk,"NHS Property Services, Regent House","Heaton Lane, ,",Stockport,"SK4 1BS","UNITED KINGDOM","07788 334756",,,"https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/Account/Login?cid=NHSPS ",,18/11/2022,31/03/2024,01/09/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Works,548700,,21/12/2022,17272400,"[Darwin Group Ltd|London House, Shawbury Business Park, Shawbury Business Park, SY4 4EA, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, SY4 4EA, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE||No|No]",,18/11/2022,31/03/2024,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,12:00

The key objectives include the following:
1.	Understand which of the gaps in evidence and understanding from the 2021/22 work should be developed in further detail in this project.
2.	Consolidate findings from the following 2021/22 projects including:
a.	Critical Success Factors of Transport Interchanges on the SRN
b.	Incentivisation Project
c.	End to End Journeys Project
d.	Other relevant evidence e.g., Route Strategies
3.	Better understand customer perspectives and behaviours in relation to re-moding within different contexts, and how this could influence future NH investment opportunities.
4.	Understand what National Highways' role is in supporting travel choice and re-moding from the perspective of:
a.	Bus and Coach operators
b.	Local and National Stakeholder (STBs, TF, Bus and Coach Operators)
5.	Customers - including segmentation of susceptible customers
6.	Identify and understand how we use our existing infrastructure and assets to support re-moding of single-occupancy car trips and in what scenarios
7.	Determine and detail the intervention opportunities; 
a.	What transport re-moding opportunities would work in different scenarios and why
b.	What is National Highways role in developing and delivering these
c.	Develop a framework to assist the business with potential interventions based on the location and scenario, and the cost/time/resource associated with it.

DCC currently has a network of 33 road weather stations, whilst Torbay Council has one and Plymouth City Council has three and has a reciprocal agreement to access weather stations from adjacent highways authorities. The weather stations are currently a combination of Vaisala (ROSA and later) and Findlay Irvine (Mk6 and later) supplied equipment, fitted with a range of meteorological and road sensors, and a number have the ability to transmit images.

Data is also received from a forecast provider. The primary aim of this procurement is to ensure that both actual and forecast data are integrated into visualization software which is accessible through web browsers. 

The Devon Consortium will access the bureau service as if one customer, but the individual logins shall provide suitable configuration to each separate Authorities requirement.  All data shall be freely made available across Devon Consortium.

Devon also has a control room where this information is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week throughout the year, to support the winter service and a proportion of the data is monitored through the summer, to aid decisions on weather and temperature dependent highway maintenance activities. The control room is generally single staffed out of hours and data is accessed via the internet, this data is also accessed by staff across the county who are on duty both in and out of hours, at work and at other locations including home.

This is a business-critical service, resilience is vital, as timely data is used to monitor the road temperatures and state and determine if any change is required to the winter action and to maintain records for future use. This is fundamental to the Authority's legal defence of winter claims and the delivery of some statutory duties.

-Provides opportunities to engage with other autistic people who may have had similar experiences.
-Helps the parent/carer or young person feel empowered in living with their diagnosis.

This commission is for an initial six-month period and is to undertake Computer Aided Design (CAD) Services on a 'call off' basis providing all aspects of CAD services, including an element of knowledge transfer, as required. This will involve the provision of detailed CAD designs and drawings in a format to be agreed with the client. It is expected that the vast majority of this work can be completed in the client's offices in County Hall, Northleigh, Chichester but the client will be flexible where possible to allow remote working by agreement. Typical activities are laid out below, but this commission could expand to include many other aspects of CAD. This commission may be extended beyond the initial period, by up to an additional six months, according to the needs of the client and by agreement between the parties.

A refresh of the action plan supporting this strategy was agreed by Cabinet in September 2022.  Objective 5 of the action plan relates to the workforce (see Appendix 1) and the planned actions listed here are now underway. This element of the strategy is currently highest priority for the Council, which is prompting the review.
      Birmingham City Council is committed to eliminating discrimination, promoting equal opportunities, and valuing the diversity of the communities we serve in employment and service delivery. We will 'walk the talk' through truly inclusive leadership that models and drives this agenda forward. We recognise that the council is at its best when it reflects the diversity of our city and can understand what the city needs.  
      
      People (HR) professionals play a huge part in developing and delivering our ambitious inclusion agenda. It is essential they have the trust of all our staff, including those with protected characteristics.
      
      The Council is seeking specialist expertise and support from a suitably qualified and experienced third-party provider to undertake an independent review of People Services from a diversity and inclusion perspective.  
      
      The purpose of this review is to establish a baseline for the competence, capability, and capacity of our People Services team, followed by a gap analysis and action plan to move towards a ""best in class"" approach to inclusion from an employment perspective.
      
      Commencement of this work will be the week beginning 9th January 2023 and is estimated to take approx. two months. 
      
      Presentation of the final report will be required to be presented to the Birmingham City Council's Cabinet in March 2023 and will inform the Council's Business Planning for 2023-24 onwards to ensure the action plan is embedded and monitored.

The path is located in Chilham, Ashford.

In recent years the surface of the Byway has become significantly rutted, with loose flints and stones dispersed throughout, and at sections, the underlying native chalk substrate exposed, a consequence of heavy rainfall and the flow of surface water combined with the gradient of the path.

Frequent pedestrian, cycle and equestrian traffic along this section of the Byway, as well as its current condition prevent it from recovering and continued use by these groups will cause it to deteriorate further and inhibit use from this range of user groups both during dry and wet weather.

The intention is to create a planer path with a slight crossfall to steer and allow surface water to run off the path into adjacent woodland. Where there is woodland or drainage ditches on either side of the path, a cambered surface on the Byway is proposed.

The North Downs Way (NDW), which has National Trail status, is a popular and heavily used trail through Kent and recognised and lauded for its spectacular views and fascinating heritage, traversing the Kent Downs Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. By carrying out repairs and improvements to the surface, it will maintain access, allows safe an accessible passage and supports continued and longer-term tourism, as well as sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits. Furthermore, the improvements will facilitate and mitigate the expected increase in the number of people using the route and rural Anti-Social Behaviour, together with significantly reducing further damage to the surface.

The Experience project supports the development and delivery of sustainable projects that enable the improvement and enjoyment of the Kent countryside, particularly those which can be promoted and used by the local community and visitors during the winter months (October to March, referred to as the 'off season').

The Experience project focuses on outdoor tourism activities and opportunities which actively encourage and attract walkers, cyclists and equestrians to the Kent countryside, as well as promoting active travel and supporting the local economy. The East Kent Public Rights of Way (PROW) Team has a particular remit to improve the routes along the Cycling UK East Kent Riders Route, as well as the renowned National Trail, the North Downs Way, both of which this Byway is part of.

Through the Experience Project funding, the East Kent PROW team have a dedicated project budget to support and proactively deliver infrastructure improvement projects that mutually contribute to and achieve these outcomes.
There is a requirement for prompt delivery and completion, as the Experience Project concludes at the end of March 2023, by which time the funding allocated to support these improvement works must be spent.

Adverts were placed on Contracts Finder and the Find a Tender Service and an Invitation to Tender (ITT) process, based on the Open procedure, was undertaken during summer / autumn 2022 to identify the Most Economically Advantageous Tender and therefore determine the incoming provider.  

In 2019, the ICB was successfully awarded funding to be one of 12 national early implementer sites to deliver Community Mental Health (CMH) transformation. This has enabled the design and implementation of integrated primary and community mental health care for adults and older adults with Significant Mental Illness (SMI), built around Primary Care Networks (PCNs), so that more patients with SMI are effectively supported in primary care. 

As part of the ICS-wide CMH transformation programme, there will be a total of 9 MHICS Teams, covering the 10 PCNs across East Berkshire. MHICS offers a service to patients in primary care with significant mental health difficulties who have not met the criteria for, or whose needs are not met by existing primary and secondary care mental health services. Flow into the MHICS service is mainly from primary care, but also for patients stepping down from secondary care and will continue to evolve as part of the One Team approach as the programme continues to transform the way people with mental health needs are supported in their communities. 

The Community Connectors will form part of the core MHICS team (minimum 1 WTE Community Connector per team), and their role will include: 

â¢	Help identify psychoeducational, emotional, socio-economic needs that impact on mental wellbeing through direct 1:1 work with MHICS clients, and use this understanding to support engagement and access to appropriate local and community resources  

â¢	Actively link, develop and bridge out to the infrastructure of VCSE support services across East Berkshire to offer: 
-	Earlier intervention 
-	Longer appointment time 
-	Practical support and help 
-	Guided self-help resources 
-	Follow ups and ongoing support 
-	Onward bridging where needed 
-	Links with community resources 
-	Particular links into Wellbeing Services and Carer Support

Urgent Care 
Provision of a High Intensity User Service (Reference: NHS/SOEPS/21.825 ITT)
NHS Brighton and Hove Clinical Commissioning Group
NHS East Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group

The Commissioner is seeking bids from suitably qualified Providers for provision of a High Intensity User Service, offering patients with high attendance at Emergency Departments psychosocial support, crisis planning, sign-posting in the community and support to use more appropriate services for their psychosocial needs. The service is to be situated in both Brighton and Hove and East Sussex and delivered under the standard NHS Contract. The anticipated value of the Service is a maximum of Â£343,952.00 per annum and the contract duration will be 3 years from 28th September 2022, plus an optional (option of the Commissioner) extension period of up to a further 24 months.

Key Aims and Objectives of the Service
The High Intensity User Service (HIUS) is based on the 'Blackpool model' developed by Blackpool CCG, as published in the Commissioning for Value Casebook, February 2015.  
The model offers a robust way of reducing HIU activity to EDs, 999, NHS 111, Primary Care services as well as unscheduled hospital admissions. The HIU service liberates front line resources to focus on those who need it most and helps reduce costs.  
The objective of the service is to work closely with identified frequent users of emergency urgent departments, with an aim to reduce unheralded attendances at ED and associated non-elective (NEL) admissions, whilst improving the service user's quality of life and outcomes.  
This will be delivered by:
â¢	Identifying patients who frequently attend ED and associated non-elective (NEL) admissions
â¢	Identifying patients who are evidentially on a trajectory to becoming a high intensity user of emergency services
â¢	Proactively connecting and engaging with the patient
â¢	Supporting the patient to manage their needs using a personalised approach.

The Homeless Reduction Act has increased the responsibilities of Local Authorities in relation to service provision for homelessness.  This has seen increased demand for Council services and for wider commissioned and community provision.  Our model for homeless and accommodation support services for adults and young people is focused on the principles of prevention, independence, resilience and recovery, strengthening community connections and transforming models of support to divert people away from inappropriate use of and dependence on health and social care services.  
To succeed we need the Provider to work in partnership with the Council and to work effectively with commissioned and non-commissioned Providers and local communities. 
Outreach will be undertaken seven days a week.  The outreach will be both proactive and assertive and take place during daytime, evenings and at weekends across the borough, to engage rough sleepers in the homelessness service.  Specific focus will be given to Wigan and Leigh town centres however the service will need to respond to reports outside of these locations.

The system is required to be a reliable and highly accurate 96 well fluorometer and spectrophotometer that can quantify nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) using these two methods. 

The system should have the following features:

1.	be able to function not only as a 96 well fluorometer but also have the capability to act as a 96 well spectrophotometer when required. 
a.	it must have the ability to measure UV absorbance at 260/280nm and at 260/230nm.
2.	have very low crosstalk (7x or less) between wells for accurate quantification. This is vital because of the downstream processes it will be used for, namely quantification of libraries for both second and third generation sequencing technologies, which require very accurate amounts of DNA to be added to these systems.
3.	be compatible with the MaxwellÂ® RSC Instrument allowing quantification of nucleic acids extracted by this system.
4.	be compact and suitable for bench top use.
5.	have a fast read speed, ideally no more than 3-5 minutes.
6.	have an integrated tablet PC along with a user-friendly intuitive software.

      Mole Valley lies at the heart of Surrey, mid-way between London and the Sussex coast. It has a population of approximately 86,000 people. The majority of the district's population live in the main towns and villages of the district, in particular, Dorking and Leatherhead. Mole Valley's countryside is extensive, accounting for more than 90% of the district's area. It contains a host of very attractive villages and hamlets. Large parts are included within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
      
      Mole Valley District Council (MVDC) is committed to ensuring sustainability remains a key objective for Mole Valley and the council has an ambitious carbon reduction target to ensure their operations are carbon neutral by 2030. One of MVDC's climate change strategies is to reduce energy consumption and emissions by promoting energy efficiency measures, renewable energy sources and behaviour change https://www.molevalley.gov.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/MVDC Climate Change Strategy 2020_0.pdf. 
      
       The provision of electric vehicle charging points (EVCPs) across a number of MVDC owned public car parks is an important step towards meeting these objectives. To this end MVDC has secured Government funding to support the roll out of 90 EVCPs in key locations in Mole Valley. Mole Valley (Figure 1) provides over 2,000 car parking spaces across 22 car parks and is a popular destination as a place to live, visit and work and there is therefore an increasing demand for EVCPs within the district both for destination and off street overnight charging. Currently the provision of public EVCPs within Mole Valley is moderately low therefore the creation of 90 new EVCPs is a significant step to supporting the district's sustainability goals as well as meet the increasing demand from electric vehicle users.",,"RH4 1SJ","South East","34144900 ","Mole Valley District Council",procurement@horsham.gov.uk,Dorking,Surrey,Surrey,"RH4 1SJ","United Kingdom",01403215299,,,,,09/01/2023,08/01/2033,21/10/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Works,0,0,20/12/2022,359770.52,"[EB Charging Ltd|Beech House (Unit 1), Porters Wood, St Albans, Herefordshire, United Kingdom, AL3 6PQ|NONE||No|No]",,09/01/2023,08/01/2033,"Other ",,12:00

Therefore, actions on mental health will have significant impact on reaching the NHS net zero targets. There is a large workforce working in mental health - for example, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has 20,000 members - and thus there is a large opportunity to gather evidence and insights into how to best deliver high quality, low carbon mental health care.
We are seeking to ensure that the 20,000 members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the 20,000 psychologists, the 40,000 mental health nurses, and all other staff involved in delivering mental health care have access to clear resources and support to enable them to understand and deliver net zero mental health care. We anticipate that to deliver this a commission, literature review and gathering of insights from mental health professionals will be required to support the delivery of high quality resources. We anticipate that such a commission would be made up of a range of stakeholders that reflect the broad scope of mental health care, including mental health clinicians, providers, commissioners and patient and carer representatives. Furthermore, this could be supported by the creation of a net zero mental health learning community who would meet virtually and in person and share innovation, learning and best practice.

A full review of our intranet was carried out in 2019 leading to recommendations, but the project was halted due to the pandemic. We are now restarting the project again and need help to create an intranet strategy and development plan.

The British Council has over 20 separate intranets on its SharePoint platform, each serving different regions across our global organisation, with content for each managed in silos. For some years, a lack of ownership and governance has led to underinvestment in resource, deteriorating governance, poor content management, and heightened information and communication risks. Our current 'out-of-the-box' SharePoint Online intranet solution doesn't offer enough flexibility in design, nor gives sufficient metrics.

In 2019, the Internal Communications team took ownership of a project to develop a new strategy for the intranet, and to create a more comprehensive employee workspace that coherently brings together news, information, collaboration, and access to tools in a modern and extremely user-friendly way. To make sure employee's experience matches their experience in their personal lives, we need to link any solution to our employee data (SAP Success Factors) so that we can have full comms targeting and personalisation.",,,"Rest of the World","72212220 72421000 ",,uk.procurement@britishcouncil.org,"1 Redman Place",,LONDON,E201JQ,England,,,,,"Bidders should register on the British Council's e-Tendering portal In-Tend https://in-tendhost.co.uk/britishcouncil/aspx/Home in order to take part in the tender process.

DCC001-DN635145-67127293,Contract,"Durham County Council",Awarded,2022-12-19T13:58:50Z,"Independent NHS Complaints Advocacy","The Independent NHS Complaints Advocacy Service in County Durham is provided in two parts:

â¢	Level 1 - Information and Advice: to include signposting, self-help, core office functions and marketing
â¢	Level 2 - Direct Advocacy provision. Where a Service User needs the assistance of a qualified Advocate to help them to make 
        their complaint

Since April 2013, Local Authorities have had a statutory duty to commission independent advocacy services to provide support in order for people to make a complaint about their NHS care or treatment.  

NHS Complaints advocacy is a specialist service which supports people who are considering, or wishing to make a complaint about the health services they receive.  It bridges gaps between people and services, giving people the confidence, skills and power to raise concerns and let health services know when things have gone wrong. 

In this context advocacy can help people to have their concerns aired and considered before they make a formal complaint. The need for NHS complaints advocacy has developed as many people find it difficult to raise a concern or make a complaint, especially in cases where they are receiving on-going support from the services they wish to complain about. Others find the complaints handling process confusing and complex and need reassurance and practical support to navigate their way through.

The Council believes that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) applies to this contract.
