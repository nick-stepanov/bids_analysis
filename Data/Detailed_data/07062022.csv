The agency will need to advertise the positions and undertake a search;  we would expect the agency to be able to draw on an existing database of appropriate contacts, including in the higher education sector.

We are seeking to appoint:
-	A chair, who will not be a member of the QAA Board, but may be invited to attend part or all of specific QAA Board meetings;
-	Three or four members from English Universities, drawn from different parts of the higher education sector and bringing a diverse range of experience; 
-	One member who has current or recent status as a student in England (normally with some experience of student representative work) and who does not serve on QAA's Board or other Committees;
-	One member from a College with HE degree-awarding powers in England;
-	One member from a validated or franchised provider of higher education in England;
-	If this expertise is not provided by another member, one member from a professional body (PSRB).
  
The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) is a charity, the independent quality body for UK higher education and one of the world's experts in quality assurance.  We work with governments, agencies and institutions globally to benefit UK higher education and its international reputation.  We work across all four nations of the UK, but in England we have two distinct roles, separated by an ethical barrier.  One of these is the Designated Quality Body function, through which we, as the body designated by the Secretary of State, assess quality and standards in English higher education to inform regulatory decision-making by the regulator, the Office for Students.  This is entirely separate from our work in partnership with our members to secure academic standards, enhance quality and promote the reputation of UK higher education across the world.  QAA announced the creation of the DQBE Board in March 2022, following an internal review of our strategic and operational models.  

This procurement will be managed electronically by QAA's Governance Team. The closing date for tenders is 10th May at 5pm.

then be represented by a range of options, known as levels. These attributes and levels can be formulated into a range of
different scenarios, each of which represents a different combination of levels for each attribute. Respondents are asked to make
a series of choices within scenario sets and, through their choices, inferences can be made about their relative preferences across
attributes/levels. While respondents are only subjected to a small number of possible combinations of these levels, Bayesian
statistical methods can be applied to determine the impact on treatment preference for any combination of attribute levels.
A first step of the DCE is to define the most relevant attributes for relevant COPD treatment/ management strategies and, for
each attribute, to define the levels to be tested. It is recommended to use a maximum of eight attributes with two to three
levels. With more than 8 attributes, there is a risk that respondents start to use simplifying heuristics to answer questions and
they will typically only focus on 2-3 attributes important to themselves when making choices between scenarios, thereby
potentially reducing the robustness of the results.",,"ST4 4LX",,"73110000 ","Samantha Yates",samantha.yates6@nhs.net,"Heron House,120 Grove Road",,"STOKE ON TRENT",B709LD,England,"01782 872500",,"MLCSU - 851 - 838024663 - SC-PROC15_PIMS-202111-6071_HEU097-SSPH_IPSOS-DCE_signed_Redacted.pdf ",,,02/06/2022,01/12/2022,01/06/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,43000,,02/06/2022,43000,"[IPSOS RESEARCH LTD|3 Thomas More Square

The number of operational buildings is expected to reduce as the Council's estate rationalisation programme progresses. The Council has  a mix of electricity (half hourly and non-half hourly) and gas meters for its sites and infrastructure.

The Council seeks to procure flexible supply contracts for 2 lots - Lot 1 Electricity  and Lot 2 Gas and via an Open procedure procurement exercise. Each Lot will be awarded to a single supplier for the contract duration. Each contract will be for an initial term of 3 years (commencing 1st October 2022), with an option to extend for up to a further 3 years, at the Council's discretion.

Bidders must be Ofgem licensed energy suppliers, and are required to offer a flexible supply contract, which encompasses the ability to forward purchase the commodity element via a trading desk using OTC (Over the counter) after the contract has been completed. In addition, bidders for Lot 1 Electricity must: (i) be able to provide sleeving arrangements under which any renewable electricity sourced from off-site renewable generators can potentially be included at an additional cost in the electricity supply contract should the Council choose to do so at a later date; and (ii) provide REGO (Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin) backed renewable energy across the electricity portfolio.
 
Due to current market volatility, the Council will require Bidders to submit indicative Swing/Shape fees in their pricing schedules. This rate will not form part of the evaluation. Final rates will be agreed with the successful Bidder(s), using their submitted indicative rate as a benchmark.

Bidders must note that, due to the Council's ongoing estate rationalisation plans, consumption across both Lots is likely to decrease over the life of the contracts.

Annual consumption figures are:

Electricity (NHH and HH):
Number of sites: 317 // Total Annual Consumption: 39,495,720 kWh

Gas:
Number of sites:  114 // Total Annual Consumption: 17,198,184 kWh

Bidders must also note that is the Lots are for energy supply contracts only. The Council's bureau and trade desk services are contracted to a third party provider. Therefore, the Council will, from time to time, use its authorised third party provider to manage the supply contracts including, but not limited to, purchases of electricity and gas.",,,England,"09120000 09310000 ","Natasha I-Goldsmith",Natasha.I-Goldsmith2@essex.gov.uk,"County Hall","Market Road",Chelmsford,"CM1 1QH",England,,https://www.essex.gov.uk/,,,"Key selection criteria, in addition to the Selection Questionnaire, include the product specification, fixed costs, T&Cs, Pricing submission, REGO, commission, basic trading requirement, default position, day ahead functionality, reforecasting, payment and process service, account management structure (including supplier meetings), site additions/removals, commodity and non commodity invoicing, adherence to service level agreements, power purchase agreement requirements, electronic billing and web portal access, billing and volume variation on a pass/fail basis.

Festivals and events play a vital role in bringing communities together, transforming experience and perceptions of place and attracting visitors to the region. There is already a thriving festival ecology across the Tees Valley and to support the growth of the indigenous festivals ecology, TVCA has launched a Festivals Scale Up Programme (FSUP), the first initiative of the new Growth Programme for the Creative and Visitor Economies. The FSUP is a strategic and ambitious intervention to support the growth and sustainability of the region's most exciting indigenous festivals. 
 
The Festivals Scale Up Programme will support a portfolio of festival businesses/organisations (8-10) over a four-year period (2022/23 - 2025/26). Support will include a mix of grant funding, training, specialist information, advice and guidance, access to industry or professional services support, mentoring, and access to a peer-to-peer network. 
 
TVCA wishes to secure the services of specialist sector organisation/business who can work with the festival businesses and organisations in the Festival Scale Up Programme across the four-year programme to support them to scale up, commercialise and plan for a sustainable future. 
 
TVCA want to provide festival businesses with access to creative and cultural industry business specialists who can provide independent advice, guidance, challenge and outside the box thinking to enable festival businesses to develop ambitious yet achievable growth/scale up targets.  
 
We require a package of support and consultancy from a creative and cultural industry specialist delivery partner which features the following; 
1.	Business Planning - supporting diagnostics, preparing a business plan, modelling options, change management, growth management, critical thinking, visioning,  
2.	Governance - legal structures, policies, managing a board/trustees 
3.	Fundraising - Developing a case for support - Trust and Foundations, individual giving, corporate giving and sponsorship 
4.	Developing Earned Income - new approaches to trading activity - commercialisation, generating IP. 
5.	Marketing & Audience Development - target markets/audience development 
6.	Mentoring/Critical Friend - one to one support 
7.	Tailored consultancy - to be identified as necessary, based on individual needs of the festival. 
8.	Programme of peer insights - industry talks/meet the funder/ key issues Q&As 

The programme must be tailored and responsive to the specific needs of individual festival businesses. However, where there are common development needs across the portfolio, shared learning sessions may be appropriate. We therefore envisage that delivery will be a mix of both group training sessions/workshops and one to one sessions/support/interventions.",,,"North East","79953000 ","Karen Kreczak",karen.kreczak@teesworks.co.uk,"Cavendish House,Prince's Wharf, Thornaby",,STOCKTON-ON-TEES,TS176QY,England,07719079346,,,,,01/06/2022,01/06/2026,30/05/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,100000,,01/06/2022,99725,"[CAUSE4 LTD|Keystone Innovation Centre, Croxton Road, Thetford, Norfolk, IP24 1JD|COMPANIES_HOUSE|06658983|Yes|No]",,01/06/2022,01/06/2026,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

is committed to maintaining it's housing stock in line with the national 
housing quality and decent homes standards and relevant legislation.
The council is responsible for c.5,000 properties across the Winchester 
district and has formulated a 30 year maintenance and replacement programme 
which identifies roofing replacement works and due dates and the Council has 
engaged external contractors to undertake the works.
The council has appointed a maximum of six contractors to provide roof 
replacement works throughout the year across the District of Winchester via 
this framework agreement.
The framework is established for use by Winchester City Council only. It is
envisaged circa 250 roofs p.a may be replaced across Winchester's 
administrative district issuing work orders for roof replacement works 
although no guarantees can be given regarding anticipated volumes.
The contract area will cover Winchester, Alresford, Bishops Waltham, Denmead, 
Whiteley and Wickham and rural areas and villages surrounding these 
settlements. It encompasses an area of around 250 square miles.
It was envisaged that the framework would be divided into two lots and 
applicants applied for one lot only and tender for work packages issued 
by the council based on two value bands; Lot 1 for work estimated to be 
<£250k and Lot 2 for work packages estimated to be ≥£250k.
However, due to insufficient applicants for the council to operate the two
separate Lots successfully and as set out in the tender documents the 
council is to operate the framework with a single Lot and any direct call 
- offs of a work package will be offered regardless of value in accordance 
with ""Schedule 5 Tasks"" of the Framework Agreement or via a mini competition.

Due to the high risk of the existing cable of becoming an inherent fault once touched due to its age and construction, there is a high risk that should any fault in the cable become apparent, it would not be able to be repaired and would require replacement. The time required to do this would make the  Norfolk Terrace totally or part thereof  not available for let.

3243/JN,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD",Awarded,2022-07-04T10:24:40+01:00,"3243/JN - Fused Filament 3D Printer","With co-funding from the European Regional Development Fund, the University of Sheffield has established a flagship national Translation Energy Research Centre (TERC) - a multitechnology, integrated platform for research, development and innovation at pilot-scale, to understand and demonstrate green energy solutions for a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system. It is one of the largest and best-equipped research and development facilities in Europe for zero-carbon energy, hydrogen, bioenergy, CCUS and combustion. Low-carbon, sustainable energy (heat/power) generation is a key priority for the UK and internationally, with significant global opportunities for technology development and commercialisation. The centre has a range of novel pilot scale technologies and is continuously evolving to meet industrial research requirements. Often there is a need to design and manufacture proptypes, jigs, parts and tools quickly and effectively in order to react to the needs of the research programme. Therefore, the operational team is exploring the use of 3D printing technologies to support these activities.

The TERC operational team has explored a range of 3D printing technologies and whilst metal based printers offer high performance, the complexity of design, print time, build restriction and multiphased manufacture process mean that this technology is not considered suitable for the required application. Furthermore, manufactured parts will need to endure reasonably high temperatures and possess reasonably high strength properties, so base level plastic printing methods are not considered adequate. Therefore, the operational team is looking to procure a composite based 3D printing system, capable of providing the desired flexibility as well as strength, accuracy and size of the application summarised in the technical specification.

In summary, the service requirements are concerned with the development of a compatible ICCS product upgrade that enables the supplier's control room ICCS product(s) (as deployed to the supplier's UK 3ES customers) to interface to ESN, for the minimum subset of Kodiak 12 (K12) features as set out in the contract schedules.
Kodiak is the mission critical push to talk application (provided by Motorola Solutions UK Limited) used on ESN to connect the 3ES to the EE mobile network (the ESN's mobile network operator).  It is critical that the 3ES control rooms are compatible with ESN.  If they are not, ESN will not work, and this could endanger life.  
This Notice is for the provision of services in connection with the development of Systel's IRIS Solution against Kodiak 12 (K12).  It should be noted that the contracting authority may require Systel to provide further development work in the future, as may be relevant for newer versions of the release.",,"SW1H 9EX","Any region","72212517 72212100 ","ESMCP Commercial Team",ESMCPsupplier@homeoffice.gov.uk,"2 Marsham Street, Westminster",,London,"SW1P 4DF",GB,,,,"https://atamis-8888.cloudforce.com/sfc/p/58000000L5A4/a/4I000001R7Ul/e_tNv8DvwJk.t2qjP4iW3yVMmkqkV_tMTQ0bVfMZMQg ","The Authority has contracted with a number of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to provide Integrated Communications Control Systems (ICCS) services for the emergency services (3ES). Each OEM has proprietary systems that must be developed to ensure compatibility with the Emergency Services Network (ESN) when it goes live. The Authority has contracted with the relevant OEMs to carry out this development work (i.e. each has a contract to develop their own respective systems). One of those OEMs is Systel, which is carrying out development work on its proprietary system (called IRIS) accordingly. Systel's contract with the Authority, under which it is carrying out that development work, is to be replaced with a new contract with greater scope and increased cost to ensure compatibility against the latest Kodiak iteration (Kodiak 12). Systel is the only supplier that can provide these development services, most notably because it owns the intellectual property rights (IPRs) to IRIS, and does not license them to third party developers who might otherwise be able to do so. The parameters of the procurement are a function of the development work needed to make IRIS ESN compatible. The Authority has already contracted or is in the process of reaching an agreement with the rest of the market, either on a similar basis or under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to make sure that all available ICCS solutions (i.e. Systel's and those of its competitors) are developed to be compatible with ESN. The Authority has actively sought to ensure that competition is maintained across the marketplace.  The purpose of this particular procurement is to ensure 3ES users of Systel's IRIS system have an ESN compatible product.  This procurement will prevent Systel from being disadvantaged in comparison to the rest of the marketplace, enabling all market players to compete fairly and offer ESN compatible control room solutions when 3ES procure control rooms in the future.  The value of the proposed changes to Systel's contract is such that to comply with the PCR 2015 (as amended), the Authority must award a new contract to Systel.   The above justifies, the use of a direct award relying on Reg 32(2)(b)(iii), where the services can only be supplied by a particular operator for the protection of exclusive rights including IPRs, no reasonable alternative or substitute exists and the absence of competition is not the result of an artificial narrowing of the parameters of the procurement.

NS&I's core services are currently provided by Atos IT Services UK Limited, which manages sales processing and customer servicing, in addition to IT and infrastructure services.

The Digital integration and Service Operations package is intended to be the technical and operational centre of the Future Operating Model. It focuses on implementing a future integration platform to support upcoming business change, as well as providing Service Operations capabilities to establish a stable state for delivering long-term business objectives. In addition, this package will include the provision of a Central Security Monitoring Service. The purpose of this service is to provide NS&I with a central capability to manage security events across the multiple, potentially separately delivered elements, of the Future Operating Model.

The aim of this project is to establish a young people's Peer Education Network focussing on two key COVID objectives:

1.	Direct COVID related engagement and support
2.	COVID recovery support, there has been significant direct and indirect impact of COVID on young people. This project will support young people in a holistic way and may include creating safe places for young people to have conversations on COVID or their health and well-being, or creating peer networks or connections/information/services to support young people.  

Whilst this project is for all 16-30 year olds we want a strong engagement that reaches the underrepresented groups in this age cohort such as those with additional needs, young people from more deprived backgrounds, young carers, young people who are or may have been looked after, young people who may not be in any education employment or training and also representing the ethnic diversity in Merton.

      Background - North Star is not a direct labour organisation and as such all works are completed by third party contractors. Our current responsive maintenance contract is operated in a traditional way but North Star are looking to redefine our approach to repairs and are looking for innovative ideas to improve our service offering. 
      Specification Documents have been provided to act as a basic guide to the basis of the works required but there are some areas that are open for negotiation. For clarity we are looking to award to one sole contractor to operate both of these contracts and are not looking to split them into separate lots.  
      
      Replacement Kitchen & Bathroom Programme - We also have the opportunity to include our replacement programmes for Kitchens and Bathrooms. This will be discussed with shortlisted bidders during this process but it will not be mandatory to bid for these works. 
      
       It is estimated that the contract value is likely to be around £2.3m per annum with an overall contract value of approx. £23m over the full term of this contract including any extensions.

The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens (""RBGKEW"") wishes to establish a framework to undertake Architecture Consultancy support required to help develop, design and deliver projects within its programme of projects. 

Background / Expected projects & Developments

Though considerable improvements have been made in the last few years, RBG Kew currently has a significant defect liability that requires action. The extent of the backlog and a method of identifying the most urgent works was drawn up in 2018 via the completion of a site wide elemental condition survey and risk assessment. This piece of work of has been built-on and aligned with Kew's Sustainability and Energy Plans, which are targeting a carbon positive estate by 2030, to create a new five-year programme of work across the two estates.

This programme consists of infrastructure improvement, refurbishment, and conservation projects. Though not all the projects within the programme relate to listed or protected assets, conservation knowledge and design experience is required to ensure the projects are developed in a sensitive way, respectful of Kew's status as a world Heritage Site.

      Primarily via an e mail link but to date the response rates have been low. To help us increase our understanding of our tenants - who they are, their situation/ lived experiences, views on sustainability and their location, how they feel about us our service to them as a landlord etc. we want to undertake an in depth customer insight survey that will cover information about themselves / family, their views on our services and their interest in becoming an involved tenant. The survey results will also be used to inform our preparation for the new Tenant Satisfaction Measures that are being introduced next year as part of the Government Social Housing White Paper.
      
      We have approx. 5.400 properties located in three main towns - Dunstable, Houghton Regis and Leighton Buzzard and surrounding villages. Our accommodation is a mix of low rise blocks, houses and independent living schemes for older people
      
      The survey must include quantitative and qualitative questions and achieve a statistically valid number of responses covering the broad demographic of our tenant base. The survey should be carried out using the most effective method - post, phone, digital, or a combination of these. It is important to have a statistically valid number of responses and we would therefore want the proposal to detail how this will be achieved. We would look to be guided on the method to be used with information on the pros and cons of different methods and a recommendation on what to use.
      
      To explore the themes that come out of the survey there will also be approx. six focus groups held - in person or online. Focus Group participants should cover a range of demographics. The proposal should detail how this will be achieved and how the focus groups will be run.
      
      A report detailing the survey results is required containing the quantitative and qualitative results in a format whereby information can be used for a report to senior managers and communication to tenants. The report should identify demographic trends - e.g. age, family make up, location, work/income etc. The survey results should also be supplied electronically in a way that allows us to sift it by location. The surveys can be confidential but we would ask for postcodes to be supplied and contact details of the recipient wants to be included in a prize draw or has identified areas of concerns and is happy to be contacted by the Housing Service.
      
      A presentation on the key findings from the report should also be provided. A one hour session with managers will also be required to run through the key findings. This should also include time for q and a's.
      
      CBC will provide the questions to be included in the survey and focus groups and would expect to receive guidance on the design of the questions to ensure they are worded correctly for survey purposes..

The works will most likely require full planning permission due to the change in materials but this should not impact on the specified works or materials.  The existing roof is a trussed timber roof with trusses at 600mm ctrs. The original part of the roof has 'Delta' concrete tiles supported on timber battens with a '1F' underfelt.  The newer section of roof as 'Stonewold' concrete tiles supported on timber battens with a breathable felt all set at approximately 20 degrees.

The existing roof has some PV in place, this will be removed and replaced and there is the potential to have further PV added by the client.  

The main building must be kept weathertight throughout the works.

The scope allows for two separate options both of which must be priced in full against each item.  

Allow for all costs as necessary to comply with the requirements of the CDM Regulations 2015 including provision of method statements, risk assessments, Construction Phase H&S Plan and health and safety file etc.
Refer to Ridge pricing document for full details and specifications. 

We are looking to understand what level of H & S policies the company have in place generally, the levels of insurance that are in place for a project of this nature and samples of risk assessments and method statements for similar project that demonstrate good practice.  It is also important to understand the level of 'employed' staff that would be allocated to this project and if required the level of sub-contract staff, site foreman and their prior experience for similar sized projects.

Scoring will be based on the demonstration to undertake similar sized projects and to a similar value allocating the correct level of resource throughout the project.

The requirement is comprised of two pieces of equipment (1) a state-of-the-art x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) system with a particular focus on high lateral resolution and depth profiling; (2) an in-vacuum (UHV) transfer system between the new XPS and existing deposition facility, ideally with a small laboratory footprint.

Bristol has an international reputation in fabrication and characterisation of actinide thin films (for studies based on the behaviour of current and advanced nuclear fuels). The FaRMS project will upgrade our growth and characterisation facilities to allow in-situ transfer of newly grown samples to the XPS system. This will be enabled by the UHV transfer system connecting both the sputtering chamber and the XPS system, as well as allowing the sputtering system and XPS system to work independently. Our long-term vision is that this instrument will enable thin layers (from a few nanometres to micron-scale films) of nuclear fuel materials to be fabricated and characterised with a range of techniques within FaRMS and the larger IAC infrastructure.

Each Authority has its own Estates and Facilities Department and is responsible for the management of Property within their own Constabularies / Fire and Rescue Service. The departments provide a comprehensive estate and property management service which comprises an on-going maintenance, refurbishment and building plan. The estate portfolio comprises of police stations, specialist complexes, Headquarters and Police Investigation Centres and Fire & Rescue premises within the Kent and Essex lot.
	
The Estates Strategy of the Forces involves an investment plan to upgrade existing accommodation and to replace or dispose of the stock that does not feature in the long-term plans of the Forces.  It also includes an increasing focus on the ""one Public Estate"" and site sharing with partners, including the Fire and Ambulance Services. The age, style and construction forms of the built assets are varied.
