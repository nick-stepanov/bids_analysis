February 2024 - The following variations have been made since award. 

Nature and extent of the modifications (with indication of possible earlier changes to the contract):
- Variation 1: change added a new agent permission level between SAM admin and LA admin.
- Variation 2: brought forward the commencement date and end date by 1 month.
- Variation 3: addition of the Commercial Web Portal. The costs for this portal was already included for within the original contract as an additional cost that could be requested at any point during the term of the contract.
- Variation 4: change to support the partition of Cumbria County Council into two separate unitary authorities.
- Variation 5: development and ongoing maintenance of a mobile app that integrates with the ITSO AMS-HOPS Service currently procured.

Need for additional works, services or supplies by the original contractor/concessionaire. (Description of the economic or technical reasons and the inconvenience or duplication of cost preventing a change of contractor):
- Variation 5: contracting with another service provider would cause significant duplication of costs. South West Smart Applications Ltd (TA SAM) already have a deep working knowledge of the developed solution. Preparing and procuring a new contract for the mobile app that integrates with ITSO Part 11 would result in significant delay and duplication of costs in the delivery of the transport services.

In addition, a statutory requirement of The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) states that;

A practitioner must be designated to take lead responsibility for safeguarding children in every setting. Childminders must take the lead responsibility themselves. The lead practitioner is responsible for liaison with local statutory children's services agencies, and with the LSP. They must provide support, advice and guidance to any other staff on an ongoing basis, and on any specific safeguarding issue as required. The lead practitioner must attend a child protection training course (Taking account of any advice from the LSP or local authority on appropriate training courses) that enables them to identify, understand and respond appropriately to signs of possible abuse and neglect'

Therefore, we have identified the following priorities for training within the existing Early Years and Childcare Workforce and are looking for one training provider to deliver the training below.

Although private sector involvement and input will be integral, these funds have been specifically identified for local authorities to submit applications (LUF) or investment plans (SPF) to and therefore the public sector needs to take the lead. 

Tendring has been identified as a Priority 1 local authority under the LUF and as such will be submitting two bids for the second round of applications, before the 6th July 2022 deadline.

Currently, education is provided under the Prison Education Framework (""PEF""). However, the quality of the current curriculum across the prison estate is not good enough and too many prisoners leave without a plan that will help them get a job or further training on release. In 2019-20, Ofsted judged that education, skills and work was 'good' or better in only 28% of prisons. This is further evidenced by the fact that only 12% of offenders released from custody and available for work in 2019/20 were employed six weeks following their release, while 88% were unemployed. This suggests that education provision is not adequately equipping prisoners with the skills needed for employment on release.

The proposed reforms to prison education will build on the foundations that the Prison Education Framework has laid, but will also provide support and guidance to governors to ensure that they are commissioning a tailored service that provides prisoners with the relevant knowledge, skills and guidance to secure employment, further education or further training on release. By setting clear standards for education, skills and work delivery, governors across the estate will have a better understanding of what makes a quality offer, resulting in greater consistency for the prisoners in our care.


The current contract is due to expire in March 2023 and the aim is to extend it for one year to enable the new contract to be procured. The contract value will be in the region of £1 billion.

The procurement of education services will encompass the following strands, which are currently divided up into a number of different contracts:

Prison Education Framework (PEF) Core & Non Core Services
Prison Education Dynamic Purchasing System (PEDPS) Non-core curriculum services
Library services
Common Awarding Organisations

In conclusion, due to the size and scope of this re-procurement project, CLG and GLD TUPE hub need the support of external legal services to be able to successfully resource it.  Therefore, it is essential that these external legal services are procured to assist with the procurement of Education Services to ensure it is completed within the necessary timescales.",,,"Any region","79100000 80000000 ",,mojprocurementprofessionalservices@justice.gov.uk,"102 Petty France, Westminster",,London,"SW1H 9GL",England,,,"REDACTED Con_21028- Prison Education Service Final.pdf ",,,25/05/2022,24/05/2025,08/04/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,750000,,06/05/2022,750000,"[Dentons UK and Middle East LLP|One Fleet Place, London, EC4M 7WS|COMPANIES_HOUSE|OC322045|No|No]",,25/05/2022,24/05/2025,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,23:59

It is one of the largest and best-equipped research and development facilities in Europe for zero-carbon energy, hydrogen, bioenergy, CCUS and combustion.

The facility is equipped with a number of hydrogen generating and consuming pilot-scale facilities used to further innovative large scale research and green solutions. To complement this, we aim to procure a hydrogen fuel cell tests station. It will be used to investigate the impact of the operating conditions (i.e. the temperature, pressure, gas composition and humidity) on single fuel cell or small fuel cell stacks. It will be also used to investigate the effect of the new materials and/or designs on the fuel cell performance.

Feedback from consultations with businesses across a range of sectors have highlighted the need for upskilling people with project management skills, particularly where individuals are not currently working in specific project management roles but carry out aspects of project management as part of their day-to-day job. 

This may be more relevant within smaller organisations where one person might be carrying out a number of different roles. Although we are aware there are numerous qualifications available in project management, this specification is more concerned with the project management skills, knowledge and techniques that individuals can apply to their day-to-day work without necessarily holding a full qualification. 

These skills can support business growth, create pathways for progression, and prepare people for higher apprenticeships/higher levels of learning. 

The specification is part of a longer-term plan to develop skills to ensure that businesses are better able to retain and progress staff. Increasing opportunities for upskilling and investing in staff training and development has been highlighted as a key factor in reducing staff turnover. 

The overarching aim of the package is to improve skills, create pathways for progression, and prepare people for higher apprenticeships/higher levels of learning. It is expected that training is relevant to the individuals' role within the business.

Its primary focus is re-investment in the University's student record system and the policies and processes it supports.  As such, it will drive cultural and behavioural changes and ultimately, its success is measured by efficiency gains for academic and professional services staff, greater self-service functions and improved communications for and with students and, improved data quality.  The culmination of all of this change will enable staff to refocus and deliver a high quality, enhanced service to all stakeholders. Especially our students.  

The Programme is underpinned by a set of principles and objectives that will ensure that outcomes remain focused and complement overall University planning and strategic needs.  They will also establish the foundation for on-going and continuous improvement.  

These principles and objectives of the Programme are as follows:

Principles

•	Student-focused 
•	'Problem-solving not predicament management' - solve the core problem & no short-term fixes.
•	Driven by business need, enabled by technology.
•	'Re-use, before buy, before building' new software to maximise existing investment.
•	Develop future capacity and capability to develop staff and drive culture change.
•	Compliance, security and privacy through good data governance

Key Objectives

•	To be digital by default 
•	To deliver efficient and effective functions that are fit for purpose & support University strategic and operational plans. 
•	To provide value for money 
•	To provide sustainability for future planning",,"lu1 3ju",,"48000000 72000000 ","Tracy Wilson",tracy.wilson@beds.ac.uk,"University Square",,LUTON,LU13JU,England,01582743315,https://www.in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofbedfordshire/aspx/ProjectManage/588,,"https://www.in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofbedfordshire/aspx/ProjectManage/588 ",,27/01/2022,26/01/2024,17/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,,09/05/2022,0,"[University of Bedfordshire|Luton LU1 3JU|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,01/06/2022,26/01/2024,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

The campaign aims to support the UK tourism industry to post covid recovery by encouraging consumers to explore, discover and treat themselves on a UK short break.

The recovery fund allowed DMOs to apply for grant funding to deliver local marketing activities aligned to the national campaign. Marketing Liverpool was successful in it's bid to secure budget from the fund for a campaign in 2021.

The Visit England initiative has now been extended into 2022 and Marketing Liverpool has once again been successful in securing funding for a similar recovery campaign as part of a wider national campaign.

Securing this fund was through a highly competitive process. There is great expectation for the campaign to deliver for the city region and we need to ensure we maximise the opportunity.

We are now looking to secure a partner to plan and deliver an impactful media schedule.

The Campaign

Liverpool city region has been severely affected by the pandemic. Our tourism businesses are still playing catch up to pre-pandemic visitor number levels. Overseas visitors are still yet to return in significant numbers.

We anticipate there is significant pent-up demand within the domestic market to venture out (backed by national statistics) and experience what's on the doorstep.

We intend to:
• Deliver an inspiring and creative consumer campaign over several weeks activity
• Use 100% digital advertising media (as stipulated by VisitEngland)
• Use a creative mix of social media, display, video, blogs, influencer generated content and paid digital press coverage
• Launch a new campaign landing page on VisitLiverpool.com (as the call to action) featuring a selection of a minimum 10 bookable products wrapped within inspiring itinerary copy, images etc
• Add further depth through inclusion of free tourism products and experiences
• Mirror the national Visit England Escape the Everyday campaign (Liverpool content will be featured within this)
There is an excellent opportunity for several rail operators with routes into Liverpool to help amplify the campaign through their channels.
We will also amplify the campaign through Marketing Liverpool's website VisitLiverpool.com, our own social channels and through our tourism partners channels.",,,"North West","79340000 ","Greg Nixon",greg.nixon2@liverpool.gov.uk,"4th Floor, Cunard Building",,Liverpool,"L3 1DS",England,,http://www.liverpool.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=9f7668e8-32bb-ec11-8113-005056b64545 ","Please do not contact officers directly - all contact must be via ProContract portal",03/05/2022,30/06/2022,25/04/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,80000,80000,04/05/2022,80000,"[Viv'id(a) Ltd|M1 5AN|NONE||Yes|No]",,12/05/2022,30/06/2022,"Open ",,10:00

• Tier 1 - core General Practice services are at the heart of our health care system and are the first point of contact for patients. A patient's registered GP will provide the central and core service offer for the management of frail patients. This service is provided through a GP's Core Contract.
• Tier 2 - comprises of both a proactive and reactive arm. Patients will escalate to an enhanced primary care service at tier 2 by their GP as their needs become more complex and require greater coordination. The PCN frailty workforce are central to this second-tier response, providing enhanced and specialist care to the PCN frail population.
• Tier 3 - component of the service is a Primary Care led multidisciplinary team (blended and adaptable depending on patients need). The multi-disciplinary teams will provide care for the most complex of the patient cohort groups, ensuring continuity and care longevity. The tier 3 service element will be overseen by the PCN frailty lead with ready access to patient registered GP and with access to the wider MDT for support to the most complex of patients.

In order to maintain its access to critical communications and interoperability with the emergency services, National Highways must therefore also transition to ESN. In preparation, National Highways has decided to undertake a procurement exercise for a new locker infrastructure.The 750+ Airwave radios, currently used by National Highways Service Providers are, when not in use, hosted and secured in an existing Traka Locker infrastructure comprising circa 100 lockers. These lockers, which are located at SP service depots across England are not capable of hosting the ESN handsets and an alternative locker infrastructure will therefore need to be provided.

The evaluation will assess the design implementation, and impact of the Fund, as well as produce recommendation for the Fund as part of the BFI's next 10-year strategy.
      
      The total fund of £10.6m over the five year strategy includes £10m of National Lottery funding, with the remaining £0.6m coming from non-Lottery sources. They are divided between the following programmes: the Film Export Fund, UK Film-focussed activity at International Festivals and Markets, International Projects, and British Film Commission support. In addition for the financial year 2020-21, an exceptional one-off COVID-19 UK Sales Support programme was available, providing pandemic-related mitigation support. From 2017-2021, the International Fund received 205 applications and made 174 awards to circa 80 different organisations.
      
      The approach should cover both process and impact evaluation. It should consider each of the funding strands independently, how they do or do not complement one another and how they contribute to delivering the BFI2022 International Strategy. Particular attention should be paid to the British Film Commission funding, which represents a distinct and flagship element of the International Fund's work.

As part of our wider work to bolster cross-sector recovery and long-term resilience, this forthcoming innovation programme will seek to help UK heritage to explore, develop and test new approaches that have the potential to respond to long-range heritage workforce challenges. Discovery research which engaged with sector representatives evidenced workforce challenges as a consistent, persistent, and widespread theme across all heritage sectors with clear opportunities to experiment with new models of working and thinking.

As the first step, we want to provide experimenting practitioners from any sphere of UK heritage with a structured programme of support providing access to the time, skills, learning and peer support needed to stimulate and incubate new ideas for future heritage working practices. 
This initial commission spans two phases:
•	Pre-application workshops (May and October 2022) 
•	Cohort content design and facilitation across the two cohorts (August 2022 - June 2023)
NB: We anticipate two cohorts consisting of approximately 17 organisations (34 in total), will be awarded pilot funding by the Heritage Fund. Each cohort will work intensively with the innovation support partner over the initial 6 month period of their grant so that they are prepared and ready to prototype and test their ideas if further funding is secured.

The Service Provider will work closely with the Council to develop an effective enablement offer that is outcomes focused and able to meet a variety of needs. 
The Service will be directed at Adults aged between 18-65 inclusive of young Service Users coming through transition (18 plus). Service includes Service Users with Learning Disability, Physical Disability, Mental Health issues, Substance Use issues and Autism Spectrum Conditions. Access to the services will be via a Care Act 2014 assessment. Most Service Users will be those who live at home with family or other carers or who live on their own. Some may have recently followed some level of transition where they have 'stepped down' from other accommodation-based services such as supported housing, extra care or residential care into their own accommodation.
Our overall approach is characterised by innovation and partnership working. It is important for the Council to have Service Providers that genuinely work in partnership with Service Users and the Council and who actively explore, present and deliver service innovations that better meet the needs of Service Users, the Service Provider and the Council. The Service will be person-centred and build on the strengths and assets of Service Users to create sustainable care and support solutions in community settings. These services will provide regulated activity, as well as a variety of skills development, vocational, occupational, social and leisure activities. Although 
the Service is not an assumed pathway for Service Users, there will be opportunities for deployment, so some Service Users may access more than one of the three contract areas. We recognise that services will change and evolve during the life of the contract, this requires organisations to work together in partnership. The Council requires a pro-active approach which embraces innovation 
including a digital offer that can help support this principle.

In 2011 our remit was extended to include Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level indicators and in 2019 we were asked to work in partnership with NHS Digital to host and assure the national library of quality indicators.
The indicators developed or assured by NICE are added to an indicator menu (https://www.nice.org.uk/Standards-and-Indicators/index).  The menu contains 338 indicators on different topics.  Some indicators are included in national frameworks, e.g., QOF, CCG Outcome Indicator Set (CCG OIS), NHS System Oversight (CCG SOF).  Indicators can also be used by any organisation for use in local or national quality improvement schemes
Whilst NICE's work to date has focused on indicators that operate at general practice level (predominantly indicators suitable for use in the QOF) and CCG indicators for inclusion in national frameworks, NICE anticipates future indicator work will have a wider scope. 
Our scope will now extend to development of indicators at a system level to support the newer organisational structures in the NHS including integrated care systems and primary care networks.The way in which NICE develops indicators has changed over recent years and we continue to look for innovative ways to maintain robust and rigorous processes whilst being responsive and flexible.  The cycle of development needs to be flexible to react to emerging priorities identified as the challenges facing the health and social care system change.  NICE is also changing how it delivers guidance moving towards living guidelines for learning health and care systems with indicators being fundamental to measurement of outcomes and enabling feedback to NICE which will help influence guidance updates.

The contract would start from 1 June 2022.

The COVID pandemic, with the consequent need to focus resource on managing repeated waves and subsequent, ongoing recovery and restoration priorities have caused a delay in re-commissioning Tier 3 Bariatric services across Sussex, which we had intended to undertake during the 20/21 financial year. We now anticipate undertaking a procurement in the early part of 22/23 and preparation for this is underway.

Tier 3 weight management service provision aims to:

• To provide an alternative to surgical intervention

• To prepare patients adequately if a surgical intervention is required

• To improve health outcomes in severely obese patients

• To provide a maintenance plan for patients who are exiting the service

To provide a service for patients who meet the referral criteria

• To improve health outcomes in severely obese patients

• To reduce the health burden of obesity

In order to ensure that there is no break in service availability for current patients, many of whom would have only recently commenced lengthy pathways, we intend to renew the current Tier 3 weight management contracts in East Sussex (High Weald Lewes & Havens) and West Sussex CCG (for North West and Mid Sussex) with TBC Healthcare Ltd for 22 months, and in West Sussex CCG (for Coastal West Sussex) with Sussex Medical Chambers Ltd, also for 22 months. Where these contracts are superseded by contracts arising from the planned procurement, they will be terminated early in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions and in the best interests of patients.
Contract values are as follows:

TBC Healthcare Ltd:
East Sussex CCG (old HLWH CCG area) = £227,490
West Sussex CCG (for North West and Mid Sussex) = £823,405

Sussex Medical Chambers Ltd:
West Sussex CCG (for Coastal West Sussex) = £831,342.

If no expressions of interest are received, the Authority shall enter into a contract with the incumbent providers to ensure continuity of services, relying upon a Regulation 32 exemption of no response/no requests to participate have been submitted in response to this notice.

An ICS is a way of working across health and care organisations that allows them to work closer together, to take collective responsibility of the health and wellbeing of populations across large areas.

It is not anticipated that the statutory responsibility or accountability of the individual health and care organisations working as an ICS will be affected, save for the expectation that CCG organisations will be abolished and functions transferred to the ICS.

Integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems oﬀer multiple opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production systems. Circular systems have been proposed to increase resource use eﬃciency, particularly of scarce nutrients, in a more sustainable way than conventional systems. Therefore, bringing in circularity contributes to minimizing the environmental footprint of agriculture.  A clear picture of potential synergies and trade-oﬀs is required before prioritizing solutions. We will develop a matrix of (existing) indicators for eﬀective quantiﬁcation of the status of circularity within various integrated system case studies in four European countries (Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and UK) and three South American countries (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay). Contrasting scenarios of carbon, nutrients, water, and biomass ﬂows will be simulated in the case studies through the application of process-based models such as manure-DNDC.

This contract provides Adult Education Skills and Training throughout the West Midlands Combined Authority area.

The impact of the pandemic has been unprecedented and widespread across our residents communities, and businesses and we are currently experiencing a challenging economic picture. Employment is flat, while falling unemployment masks a continuing decline in the size of the labour force as economic inactivity rises. While short-term unemployment is at its lowest ever, long-term unemployment is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Record vacancies signal that employers are finding it increasingly hard to fill posts. And while pay is increasing, soaring inflation means that it is declining in real terms. Taken together, this creates a toxic mix for living standards that will not resolve itself. The provision of training has a key role to play in moving people back into the labour force; improving workplace support; and helping people find good, well-paid employment and progress at work.
We want to align our skills funding to be able to deliver maximum impact so we intend to procure provision collectively - meaning we are aiming to run a single procurement opportunity for Adult Education Budget, National Skills Fund and Multiply.

The estimated length of time expected to be able to create the new offering is anticipated to be in the region of 6 to 12 months. We are therefore intending to let the contract for an initial period of 6 months with the option to extend for a further 6 month period.

To ensure service continuity, the West Midlands Combined Authority has taken the decision to award the contract to their current providers (please see list above), under Regulation 32 of the Procurement Regulations 2015 as the Services consist of a repetition of similar services entrusted to the current providers which are the same as or similar to the Services awarded under their original contracts.",,"B19 3SD","West Midlands","80000000 ","West Midlands Combined Authority",Procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,'+443453036760,www.wmca.org.uk,,,"As stated elsewhere in this notice, the initial contract period is for 6 months, with an option to extend for a further 6 months (12 months total).
