NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU (AGCSU) is acting as an agent for and on behalf of the Commissioner and is supporting the provider selection process.
This is a reopened ITT process, (the previous EU Supply project reference was 45233) to which some bidders have already responded. Commissioners have adjusted the financial model in the reopened process and provided greater clarity on how service activity will be funded. Previous bidders are invited to confirm the non-financial responses they have already submitted or amend these if they so wish. They are asked to respond to the new financial questions.
New bidders are required to submit responses to all of the questions.
The provider selection process is described within the documentation published. This Provider Selection Process has been advertised in accordance with the requirements of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (as amended) (the ""Regulations"") to the extent that the Regulations relate to services within the scope of Schedule 3 thereto (Social and Other Specific Services). The Commissioner and AGCSU are, therefore, bound only by those parts of the Regulations applying to Schedule 3 services (also known as the ""Light Touch Regime"").
The key objective of the provider selection is to commission the Service(s) to serve the population of England. It is expected that expert care for rare Inherited White Matter Disorders (IWMDs) will already be being provided by the organisations which apply to this process and applicants will be able to demonstrate this. For this reason, applying organisations must be existing tertiary neurosciences units.
This project is split into 6 Lots, as detailed within the ITT documents.",,,"Any region","85000000 85100000 85120000 ","Josselin Canevet",josselin.canevet@nhs.net,"80 London Road",,London,"SE1 6LH",ENG,,https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/68205,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=39789&B=AGCSU https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/68205 ",,01/04/2022,01/04/2025,15/11/2021,NO,,No,No,No,Services,0,1911000,01/04/2022,2127382,"[University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust|250 Euston Road

This should enhance, organise and verify rather than duplicate the evidence provided in Community Energy England's State of the Sector report (State of the Sector 2021), Northern Powergrid's Regional Community Energy Study 2020, and other lessons learned to date (see Background below)
•	Identify the most effective, viable and sustainable model for sector building in the NEY area, (in consultation with the Energy Hub and other key stakeholders) and create a delivery blueprint, working with a selection of community energy organisations to set up, pilot, stress-test and tweak the model as needed.
•	Build and deliver a framework of support for Community Energy groups in the NEY area, using a range of methods to enhance groups' knowledge, skills, confidence and access to information in a way that will enable successful and increased delivery of renewables projects in the NEY area.

The IDEA-FAST project is a five-and-a-half-year project focused on digital endpoints in neurodegenerative and immune-mediated diseases which commenced November 2019 and is ran by a consortium of 46 partners across 15 countries in Europe, including Newcastle University. 

The project has attracted funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 853981. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program and EFPIA and PARKINSON'S DISEASE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM LBG. 

For Newcastle University's specific clinical study under this project, 2000 participants will be using a handful of wearable sensors for four individual weeks across a period of 6 months. During this period of using these sensors, a smart device is required to collect the data from the sensors, as well as prompt and collect patient-reported outcomes (PRO). 

	Based upon the technical specification outlined within Section 3, 1800 out of the 2000 participants of the clinical IDEA-FAST study are diagnosed with Neurodegenerative Disorders (NDD) or Immuno-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders (IMID), such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 	systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS). 

	Taking this into consideration, it is critical that we ensure the usability and user experience of 	the devices is acceptable, to ensure proper usage, and reduce any potential frustration. This is of extra importance with the elderly within this population. Without exact technical specifics, we can derive design features of the required phone based on prior experience in the Feasibility 	Study, and the clinical, design, and software expertise within the project.

	The output of this sourcing event will enable the University to provide the required devices to deliver the clinical study, ensuring consistency in approach and technical specification.  
	Out of Scope - Devices that utilise an IOS operating system are deemed as out of scope or devices that are defined as a tablet.

The service will work in conjunction with Cumbria Constabulary's Child Centred Policing Teams located in the North, West and South of Cumbria, and will focus on delivery around a Child Mentor model. The Child Mentor will be responsible for providing tailored and needs-led, one-to-one support to children who are displaying early signs of risk-taking behaviour and vulnerability to criminalisation. The service will work in partnership with other support organisations to build a whole system approach that creates a share vision for each child. The service will refer cases, where relevant, to other interventions, with the aim of jointly resolving issues. This service is not to replace existing practices but will offer a new layer of support. Aim/objectives: 
• Divert children away from the criminal justice system. 
• Prevent the unnecessary criminalisation of children.
• Prevent the involvement of statutory agencies. 
• Break the offending cycle. 
• Prevent further harm. 
• Support children to make better choices to improve their life opportunities. 
• Consider the wider family and ability to offer additional support, to help the child.

In 2022, we would like to move away from a mixed methodology to an all-online approach (CAWI) in part because of the impact of Covid-19 on face-to-face interviewing.
The main outputs required will include raw data, tabulated tables, a standard technical report, a series of short reports focusing on key findings from the survey and updating of the MaPS CYP Fact Pack/Fact Hub. There are other additional deliverables throughout the project such as early data from the soft launch/pilot stage, weighting schemes, interim data (midway through fieldwork for initial data checking).

2. Support for increasing uptake in specific communities, for example pregnant people and the 
Orthodox Jewish community, with scope to support others as identified and required
• Designing and facilitating workshops during the sprint periods to bring stakeholders 
together to share what is working well and where there are challenges that need 
addressing
• Rapidly collating insights from workshops and sharing in a concise and accessible 
format
• Harnessing our academic partners to research behavioural insights and findings 
beyond London which could support the programme
3. A rapid approach to gathering insights and sharing learning
• VaxHax workshops that deep dive into topics, themes and challenges that emerge as 
the programme continues. Reacting to what the system needs, developing a deeper 
understanding about specific topics and challenges; idea generation of potential 
solutions; tangible actions for next steps.
• System data workshops to provide an overview of the latest data and discussion of 
what this means, particularly in relation to VCOD activity and implementation; to 
develop an understanding of the activities that create the climate for optimum

The Council is in the process of drafting a new local plan and would like to make updates and build on the Townscape Character study as part of their evidence base, taking into consideration the new London Plan (particularly Policy D1), which aims to define an area's character to understand its capacity for growth. 

Whilst some aspects of the urban fabric have changed since 2013, these changes are not deemed sufficient to warrant a full review of the Townscape Character Study and it is considered that the update (Volume 1) will consist of a series of edits and minor amendments.

The borough wide area study is a useful way to identify areas requiring protection, enhancement or transformation, but these findings need to be further explored at a smaller scale to uncover local constraints. The update study (Volume 2) shall explore the potential for optimising brownfield land and tall buildings, review spatial relationships and assist land availability studies of specific areas. 

LBH are looking to appoint a Contractor to commence the project from March 2022 and deliver/present the study in August 2022.

The Compound Semiconductor Applications Catapult currently has circa 30 Projects in delivery phase with a strong pipeline and is looking to implement a PPM system to manage their Project Management and Resource Management functions.

We have a mix of Projects:
•	Commercial projects - usually short term and initial costing is based on a quote;
•	Collaborative R&D Projects - normally 2+ years in length and involve a mix of partners where initial costing will have been submitted in a Bid and grant monies awarded; and 
•	Internal Evaluation Model projects - these don't have Project budgets, but do track costs.

We require a system that will holistically provide Management Information from the high level initial project plan (bid/ quote stage) through to Project Delivery, showing resource capacity and utilisation, project progress, Status reports and RAG status, Budgetary baselines and forecasts with variances against actuals. 

There will be approximately 80 licensed users, including 65-70 Resources using the system to enter time against Project work assignments, the rest a mix of Project Managers/ Resource Managers and Executives requiring access to report suite.

Integration is required with Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM and potentially with 3rd party HR, Expense and PO approval systems.

The framework will be accessible to contracting authorities that fall under the NUTS code UKJ1 (Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Milton Keynes). The current contract between Buckinghamshire Council and the incumbent provider ends on 19th June 2022 and the Councils intention is to call off from the single provider framework as from 20th June 2022. Call-off terms will be for 5 years with an option to extend for up to two further years.
No work or volume is guaranteed under the framework agreement, and any participating authority wishing to utilise the framework will enter into a separate call off with the successful provider.
The service will consist of the the timely provision of:
• An Integrated Community Equipment Service (Simple Aids to Daily Living/Complex Aids to Daily Living/Non-catalogue and bespoke items)
• Domestic Lift Maintenance
• Technology Enabled Care (including Monitoring and Response elements)
• Long Term Wheelchair Product Provision and Repair
• Continence Product Provision
• Diagnostic Equipment Provision
• Long Term Conditions Management Service
• Major Adaptations
• Clinician Support Services
For each component of service listed the provider shall also carry out maintenance of equipment, collection of items no longer required, recycling of equipment and robust data gathering to support contract management.
This service will ensure that residents in Buckinghamshire, who have either healthcare or social care needs (or a combination of both) are provided with high quality equipment, aids and/or adaptations that enable them to stay independent and live healthy lives for longer, and crucially to remain at home rather than requiring formal social and healthcare support.

The anticipated annual expenditure for Buckinghamshire Integrated Community Equipment Services in 2021/22 is circa £8,900,000

The estimated spend this financial year for the geographical location that falls under NUTS code UKJ1 is £24,000,000.
However, for the purpose of estimating the entire framework maximum value, a figure of no more than £350,000,000 of service will be offered during the framework and call of duration.
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) may apply to this opportunity.

The primary role of the Adviser will be to provide a clear and sustained focus on improvement with individual local authorities where there are serious concerns about SEND strategy or operational delivery. These will usually have been identified through the local area SEND inspection system or other diagnostic work. 

The SEND Adviser will support a portfolio of designated local authorities in the allocated region in continuing to develop and implement robust, realistic and achievable plans for delivery of their SEND services. There will be a particular focus on those areas which have been judged by Ofsted and CQC to require a Written Statement of Action (WSoA), where serious concerns continue to be identified following a Revisit and/or where concerns are identified with regards to their ability to function sustainably. Advisers will be expected to align support provided with the outcomes and recommendations of the SEND Review.

Newquay Town Council (NTC) in partnership with Newquay Town Team (NTT) propose to engage a passionate, positive and vibrant multidisciplinary consultancy team including urban designers, planners, landscape architects, economists and public consultation specialists to create a 'Town Centre Development Framework and Investment Plan' following the receipt of a grant from the Town Centre Revitalisation Fund. The project is supported by Cornwall Council, NTC and the Newquay Business Improvement District, and has received specialist input from the High Streets Task Force.

The Contract will be with NTC, who will be responsible for overseeing the terms of the contract, issuing formal instructions/change requests and releasing payments.

Day-to-day interface on matters of service delivery/outputs will be with the NTT who will advise NTC on the progress towards milestones, and who will provide steering and direction, where needed. The Consultants will be expected to report at monthly hybrid meetings to the NTT.  

This is an opportunity to work with a wide range of stakeholders to shape the future of Newquay's Town Centre, ensuring it meets our needs now and into the future.  Building on the extraordinary natural and built assets of the town, the successful team will work with the local community to address the significant challenges faced by the town in becoming a successful visitor destination that also serves the needs of the local population, in a sustainable fashion. They will identify a range of ambitious but fully deliverable interventions which will match our ambitions for the town, and prepare us to capture new funding opportunities as they arise and to attract appropriate inward investment.

If this sounds like your team then please read the full project description, invitation to tender and associated documents.

Key objectives of the Town Development Framework Exercise are to ensure that the Newquay Town Centre offering adapts to meet the changing dynamics resulting in a bustling, prosperous and accessible town environment that provides an improved town centre experience that values, quality of life, the environment, fosters the sense of community and enables the restructuring, repositioning rebranding and reinvention of the town centre to become vital and viable with an improved year round offer and a sustainable future. 

This will include a clear articulation and ambitious proposition for the town centre and will take an innovative culture led regeneration approach. There will be a clear pitch to investors and the work will directly contribute to the preparation of public and private sector bids including submission by the Council to Levelling Up Funding (LUF) round 2and other funding amounts available from 2022.  
Engagement with residents and other key stakeholders will be key to successful delivery of this work, we want to see strong community input and participation. The work will also provide a programme of actions for delivery. This work must draw on a review of previous work by the Council and partners: public consultations; collaborative discussions with key stakeholders; town wide analysis and planning; Local Plan review; Culture-led regeneration initiatives; public realm improvements; and current thinking on a proposition for investment in the town. 

A list of core documents and sources of previous work will be supplied. We are looking for 3 -6 interventions that can form the basis of the short, medium and long term investment in the town. 

The Newquay Town Centre Development Framework and Investment Plan - once completed will be launched quickly in the Autumn of 2022 to maintain momentum and focus on the town centre.

Following the UK's departure from the EU, there is a requirement for import checks on certain goods of both non-EU and EU origin. Associated British Ports (ABP) are providing a new Border Control Post (BCP) that will be approved to handle a range of products and the Authority is responsible for providing the required operational resource. The Authority has seen a substantial increase in exports and associated control with the exit from the EU.

Most products of animal origin require the presence of an Official Veterinary Surgeon (OVS). This is a statutory requirement in accordance with current EU and UK legislation (UK TARP Regulations 2011, as amended or replaced, Official Control Regulations 2017/625) and requirements of the central competent authorities (DEFRA and FSA).

The Provider shall deliver official controls at the Border Control Post and maintain the full range of imports that can arrive into Grimsby and Immingham.

To fulfil these needs, LCC (former Education Dept.) bought the original AVCO AnyComms product in November 1999. The original product was basic by modern standards and the administration of the application was by producing sequel based rules within the administration tool. A new sequel script was required to route each new file type to its intended recipients, though once written this allowed users to continue to upload this file type according to their own schedule. The Council's detailed requirements are defined in the Requirements section of tender document entitled DN600467 - Managed File Transfer and Associated Services.doc available to bidders via e-tendering portal (you can download the document upon login).
