A polyclonal antibody is a critical component of a validated microneutralisation assay we have developed and implemented at Porton. The assay is used to test samples from SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials, to assess the potential of variants of concern to evade vaccines and to support pre-clinical work on the efficacy of developmental vaccines and therapeutics. The assay was developed using an antibody that was sourced from Stratech and to maintain the validated status of the assay we need to continue to have a supply of the same reagent. Any change to the reagent used required a significant amount of bridging work and potential revalidation (weeks to months) to demonstrate equivalence between the Stratech reagent and the potential replacement which is unlikely to be cost effective.

To support our advice in this area, GAD are looking to tender for a contract for the provision of a set of stochastic economic scenarios (""scenarios"", ""scenario set"" or ""economic scenario file""). 

The economic scenario file should contain stochastic forecasts of economic scenarios covering inflation, interest rates, credit, derivatives, FX and a range of asset classes. The scenarios are used in several areas of our advice, particularly for asset liability model runs for pension schemes, and are used to examine and illustrate the potential range of possible future outcomes. 

We require that a set of scenarios be provided to us regularly, at least quarterly, over the period of the contract. We also required that the scenarios:
i)	are based on sound economic principles and methods; 
ii)	are calibrated to reflect the market and economic conditions at the effective date of the calibration to ensure consistency with the date at which they are used; and
iii)	are calibrated to reflect either the provider's own view or GAD's own house-view on the long-term outcome for key economic variables in the scenario set.

GAD does not currently have a current provider of this service, though we have previously purchased one-off calibrations to support particular projects. 

In addition to the standard scenario files based on these principles, it is standard actuarial practice to consider other plausible assumptions and demonstrate the sensitivity of our advice to other assumptions. To inform this, we also require the ability to generate additional scenarios based on alternative views and calibration parameters and/or carry out stress testing on the scenario set. 
GAD recognises that it may also be possible to procure access to an ""economic scenario model"" to provide the capability for GAD to produce the scenarios files described above ourselves. Due to current levels of capacity and capability, our preference is for the scenario sets to be provided to us based on calibration targets, adjustments and stresses that are discussed and agreed with the supplier. It is therefore essential that tenderers have the capability to deliver scenarios to us directly. However, depending on the level of capacity and capability required to maintain and run such models ourselves, GAD are interested to explore this as an additional service and tenderers are invited to disclose such service provision in their response.

This resource will supplement our existing specialist IT skills and experience, to provide capacity and resilience within our work force. The work allocated will mainly focus around several key areas:

2.1.	Transformation of our IT, making data sets publicly available and continuing to move into the digital world

We're continuing to build a digital future for Defra and our customers. That means making big changes to how our services and technologies are designed and delivered across the Defra Group, and how we make our data sets accessible. Our digital services are important. They allow our customers to manage their businesses, track their livestock, apply for licenses and monitor their local flood risk. They enable our staff to work flexibly, collaborate with others and record data from sites across England.

We are looking for digitally skilled and experienced contingent labour to work, and share knowledge, with our permanent workforce to, for example, define user requirements, design digital solutions and deliver real transformation and change for an organisation that makes a difference.

Experience of working within the Government Digital Service (GDS) service standards is required.

2.2.	Supporting our new, multi-supplier operating model

Specialist IT skills are required to provide supplementary support to Defra and its newly integrated, multi-supplier operating model. Since our current contracts were awarded, there have been significant changes to ICT and the ways in which we use it. The market has grown and diversified, and Defra aim to provide high quality ICT services whilst realising even greater savings.

Service Integration is the co-ordination and assurance of the various elements of the ICT service that make up a complete offering. This covers, but is not limited to, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) processes such as:

-	Incident and problem Management
-	Specialist IT Service Management Tooling
-	IT Security Management
-	Capacity and Availability Management
-	Service Catalogue Management
-	Release and Deployment Management
-	Operational Supplier Management
-	Cloud-based systems (AWS and Azure)

2.3.	Maintaining 'business as usual' IT services

Here we are looking for experienced IT professionals to maintain and develop existing IT systems and services. Examples include the following skillsets:

-	Data-oriented disciplines
-	ITIL-based roles in the realm of service delivery and cloud-based operations
-	Project delivery at all levels
-	Quality assurance testing

Through this procurement activity, GBSLEP is seeking a provider to be able to fulfil one of three primary strands of project activity that contributes to the overall outputs and outcomes of the programme.

The project is required to deliver 20 no. no_code developed MVPs capable of launching into the market for new Founders/early-stage businesses  in the disruptive professional services technology arena encompassing fintech, HR-tech, legaltech, proptech and requires holistic support to manage founders through to MVP stage. 

The underpinning rationale for this intervention is to address critical needs of our region, which include:

- high barriers to entry for digital start-ups;

- high risk associated with new start-up ventures and the benefits of failing faster with lower upfront investment; and

- lack of inclusivity of the founder experience in key sectors such as fintech, where the average age of a founder is 48 in West Midlands, as well as being white, male and middle class.

As such, this project is fundamentally focused on democratizing the founder experience and levelling the playing field within the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Brief Description of Requirement

The aim of this work is to understand

-	how these costs and adjustments vary between different types of businesses, distinguished by size and sector.

The results of this analysis will be used to:
-	Inform the final regulatory impact assessment to support Parliament in deciding whether to move forward with the proposed regulations and the impacts they would have on businesses and consumers.

-	Act as evidence for monitoring the results of the regulatory changes, to compare actual adjustments businesses had to make in response to the regulatory changes to what business expectations had been beforehand.

The tender is divided into two lots, one for impulse ice cream and the other for scoop ice cream and accessories. Bidders are able to Bid for a single lot or both lots. The Council currently has 20 trading outlets along the seafront which the supplier(s) will be required to supply as well as five park cafés, two museums, a country park and a visitor centre. 

The Council reserves the right to ask the supplier(s) to supply further units and the Council reserves the right to close sites as well as move sites to new locations. 

The estimated value of the contract including any possible extensions is up to £2,500,000. However, Bidders should note that the spend per annum for each Lot is currently at the below levels: 

•	Lot 1 - Impulse Ice Cream - Approximate spend £120,000 per annum
•	Lot 2 - Scoop Ice Cream and Accessories - Approximate spend £230,000 per annum

However, to allow for potential increase in spend, the contract value has been set at up for £500,000 per annum. 

BCP Council does not guarantee any volume of supply during the term of the contract. The volume of supply is dependent on the number of operating units and demand. The demand is strongly led by the season, weather, school holidays as well as events such as the Bournemouth Air Show.

The contract is for three years with the option to extend annually for a further two years. Therefore, if all extensions were taken the total length of the contract would be for five years (3+1+1).

"Diverted Profits Customer Research",Contract,"H M Revenue & Customs",Awarded,2022-02-02T13:57:57Z,"Research Specification into customers' experience  of the Profit Diversion Compliance Facility & the  Diverted Profits Investigation Approach","Overview
HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) invites suppliers from the Research Marketplace agreement (RM6018) to undertake research aimed at understanding customers' experience of the Profit Diversion Compliance Facility (PDCF) and the Diverted Profits (DP) Investigation Approach.

HMRC intends for this contract to be in place by 16th December 2021, with final outputs required by 29th June 2022. 

HMRC will maintain the overall management of the project.

Context
Profit diversion is HMRC's largest Corporation Tax risk, with the OECD estimating global tax losses of $100-240bn/pa. HMRC are keen to further improve efficient ways of tackling profit diversion. 
A key area of profit diversion is the diversion of profit (DP) by large groups that: (i) Seek to avoid creating a UK permanent establishment that would make a foreign company liable to pay UK Corporation Tax, or  (ii) Use arrangements or entities that lack economic substance to exploit tax mismatches either through expenditure or the diversion of income within the group.

There are two intervention approaches* to tackling profit diversion (all customers involved in this research will have completed one of these processes):
1.The PDCF: this facility gives multi-national enterprises (MNEs)using arrangements targeted by the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT) the opportunity to bring their UK tax affairs up to date.
2. DP enquiries: HMRC has identified a number of MNEs in a variety of business sectors that could be diverting profits. HMRC have established a Programme of investigation of the arrangements of these MNEs. This will involve a review of the customer's transfer pricing arrangements. Customers under enquiry may also face a potential DPT charge, which requires an upfront cash payment whilst the enquiry is ongoing if the relevant legislative conditions are met, and, depending on the cause of inaccuracies or failures to notify, they may face penalties or civil/criminal investigations. N.B. most PDCF and DP enquiries are settled by agreeing transfer pricing adjustments, in many cases, without DPT being charged. 

Independent qualitative research is essential to: 
•Understand independent customer views on the PDCF approach/process, informing design of new compliance facilities and accompanying guidance in significant tax risk areas.  
•Compare customer experience (PDCF-vs-enquiries). 
•Provide further insight to feed into the Large Business Tax Admin Review. 
•Understand the incentives and blockers for customers choosing to participate in the PDCF. 
The findings from this research will be used to inform improvements in HMRC's strategy for tackling profit diversion and consider the appropriateness of any wider use of a compliance facility for large business, delivering upstream/downstream yield, HMRC efficiencies and improved compliance standards.",,,England,"73000000 ","Fintan Bradley",fintan.bradley@hmrc.gov.uk,"5th Floor West, Ralli Quays","3 Stanley Street",Salford,"M60 9LA",England,07530791302,,"RM6018-Letter-of-Appointment - Diverted Profits Customer Research REDACTED.pdf RM6018-Call-Off-Contract-Terms - Diverted Profits Customer Research REDACTED.pdf ",,,11/01/2022,29/06/2022,24/11/2021,NO,,No,No,No,Services,43992.88,50000,10/01/2022,50000,"[I.F.F RESEARCH LIMITED|5th Floor,St. Magnus House, 3 Lower Thames Street

Leisure Centre: RIBA Stage 2-6
Guildhall 1: RIBA Stage 1-6
Guildhall 2: 1-6
Cattle Market Car Park: RIBA Stage 1-6.

Note the existing Listed Guildhall building is not part of this commission, only the surrounding sites, Guildhall 1 and Guildhall 2 and associated public realm, including potential enhancements to the Hogsmill River. The duration of the potential contract is from August 2021 to November 2025.

The aim is to shift from more to less polluting fuels, i.e. from wet wood to dry wood, and from traditional house coal to low sulphur manufactured solid fuels. The supply of traditional house coal and wet wood sold in units under 2m³ is being phased out between 2021 and 2023. Sulphur and smoke emission limits have been introduced for manufactured solid fuels. We are aware that new fuels, such as coffee logs, are entering the market. As stated in the Clean Air Strategy, the government wants to encourage innovation, but customers need to be certain that these products are safe to use and no testing standard currently exists. Further research is needed to consider the most appropriate standard for these products to ensure that health and environmental impacts are minimised. Government intends to review these fuels with a view to setting relevant standards. Currently, these fuels are exempt from the new requirements, and may continue to be sold outside Smoke Control Areas. This project is a first step in the review of these new and emerging fuels. We want to find out the size of the market for coffee logs and other emerging waste-based fuels, and how this is responding to the recently introduced new requirements. This will help us to decide the scale of the issue, and whether it is proportionate to commission further research into emissions from these fuels with a view to introducing appropriate regulations. We are aware that, since the new measures were introduced, lignite is starting be sold as a fuel for domestic burning. The new requirements do not apply to lignite, and concerns have been raised that this is a highly polluting form of coal. We are also looking for information about the size of the market and its response to the new requirements for this fuel, and any other emerging fuels such as pet coke to see whether research and possible new standards is proportionate",,,London,"73000000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"20220120 final Ricardo Contract - Market study REDACTED_Redacted.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,13/01/2022,31/03/2022,10/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,07/01/2022,59559,"[Ricardo-AEA Ltd|The Gemini Building, Harwell, Oxfordshire, OX11 0QR, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,13/01/2022,31/03/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

DN575684,Contract,"BROMFORD HOUSING GROUP LIMITED",Awarded,2022-01-19T10:50:05Z,"Education and Awareness Consultancy","Bromford is a housing association; we exist to provide affordable homes for people who cannot access market housing. We are committed to providing safe, secure and warm homes, but also care about the people who live in our homes. Since being formed in 1963, the housing association has grown, organically and through partnerships and mergers, to own or manage 44,000 homes across the Midlands and south west.

Bromford's Security & Resilience team are seeking a partner(s) to assist in supporting the change of behaviours and culture within Bromford in relation to cyber security and business continuity awareness. We are looking for a partner to guide us on potential solutions for this and we anticipate this being achieved by designing a multi-stage process to achieve the successful implementation of an Education & Awareness programme.

We require a provider to enable this outcome to be achieved by designing an Education & Awareness programme that can be successfully implemented and measured within the organisation that adapts to a variety of different learning styles of our colleagues.

We expect the overall solution to be delivered via two contracts:
• consultancy services to provide discovery, design, and content creation (this contract);
• technology services to deliver the e-learning solution, which will be separately procured in tandem with this process.

The overall solution must be accessible to all colleagues including those not based in an office location i.e. field, roaming or home based. The proposal should be efficient to manage with our limited internal resources and make efficient use of colleague's time.

The solution is to be delivered in three stages:

Stage 1 (target duration 6 to 8 weeks from award)
• Discovery - to understand what we have currently and previous initiatives.
• Design with internal stakeholders and organisational sign-off
Stage 2 (target duration 6 to 8 weeks from completion of stage 1)

We are committed to providing safe, secure and warm homes, but also care about the people who live in our homes. Since being formed in 1963, the housing association has grown, organically and through partnerships and mergers, to own or manage 44,000 homes across the Midlands and south west.

Our core business is:
• The management of social and affordable housing
• The maintenance of social and affordable housing and associated facilities including garages
• Neighborhood coaching

Bromford invites quotations for the provision of an Education and Awareness programme.

We want a partner to enable this outcome to be achieved by providing technology services that can be successfully implemented and measured within the organisation that adapts to a variety of different learning styles of our colleagues.

We expect the overall solution to be delivered via two contracts:

• technology services to deliver the e-learning solution (this contract)

As part of this opportunity we require a provider to enable this outcome to be achieved by providing the technology services that can be successfully implemented and measured within the organisation that adapts to a variety of different learning styles of our colleagues.

The proposal should be efficient to manage with our limited internal resources and make efficient use of colleague's time.

The solution is to be delivered in three stages, according to the draft programme below. The provider will need to work in tandem with the consultancy provider, who will be required to operate to this programme:

Stage 1 Design (target duration 6 to 8 weeks from award)

• Design with internal stakeholders and organisational sign-off
Stage 2 Implementation (target duration 6 to 8 weeks from completion of stage 1)

Brief description of requirement
A 2020 Post-Implementation Review (PIR) of the scheme2 found that whilst 90% of organisations in the evaluation reported having planned or implemented an energy efficiency measure, participants did not always act upon energy savings opportunities identified through their audits, and many perceived ESOS as purely a compliance activity.

The PIR highlighted several areas where ESOS could be strengthened and improved, which resulted in a consultation (July-September 2021) into strengthening the scheme. The specific aims of improving the scheme are:
1.	To increase the number of ESOS participants that take action to reduce energy use by raising the quality of their ESOS audit;
2.	To increase the carbon and cost savings from ESOS by increasing the number and scope of ESOS recommendations taken up by participants;
3.	To ensure that ESOS recommendations are consistent with the UK's net zero commitments. 

This project is seeking to understand whether behaviourally informed interventions could be used to achieve the desired energy efficiency outcomes, as opposed to regulation to require that participants act on recommendations.

This research will provide timely evidence to inform what action is taken from the consultation. This is a joint project with the Better Regulation Executive (BRE), who work closely with teams across Government to encourage the use of non-regulatory measures to achieve policy outcomes.

This research seeks to address aims 1 and 2: to improve the quality of energy audits and increase the number and scope of ESOS recommendations taken up by participants. Currently the content and the format of the ESOS report is at the discretion of ESOS lead assessors rather than participants.

Despite the importance of audit quality in delivering savings for participating businesses, the ESOS evaluation research and the PIR identified discrepancies in the quality of audits and the presentation of recommendations within ESOS reports.",,"SW1H 0ET",,"73110000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,,,,,,04/01/2022,31/03/2022,08/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,50000,11/01/2022,49854,"[Behavioural Insight Limited|4 Matthew Parker Street
