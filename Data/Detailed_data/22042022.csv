WA12103,Contract,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT",Awarded,2023-04-20T16:27:24+01:00,"Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTR) in Avon on behalf of NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE/I) South West","NHS England and NHS Improvement South West (the Commissioner) sought to commission Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTRs) Services in Avon. 

Initially, the commissioner was seeking a provider who can deliver MHTRs focussing on Bristol Magistrates Court.

MHTRs form part of the wider Community Sentence Treatment Requirements (CSTRs) Programme which is a partnership between the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE/I), Public Health England (PHE) and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS).  

The CSTR Programme aims to develop pathways to enable and facilitate the increased use of all three treatment requirements:
-	Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTRs)
-	Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs)
-	Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATRs)

ATRs and DRRs in Avon were outside the scope of this procurement, beyond the co-ordination of CSTRs for combined orders. However, there is an expectation that MHTR and ATR & DTR providers will work closely together in the best interests of the service user, especially where it can be identified that a combined order is the best outcome.

MHTR in the context of the CSTR programme is intended for the sentencing of individuals convicted of an offence(s) which has crossed the community order sentencing threshold and may be used as an alternative to short custodial sentences for individuals who may have range of mental health, personality disorder and psychological issues/vulnerabilities which do not require forensic or secondary care treatment.

The aims of the service are to:
•	Increase the proportion of offenders with mental health issues for whom an effective mental health treatment plan is in place.
•	Reduce re-offending by addressing the underlying causes of offending behaviour. 
•	Prevent custodial sentences (especially short ones), by offering robust community treatment options.
•	Provide tailored mental health support to the most vulnerable offenders. Individuals supported by pilot sites included those who suffered from post-traumatic stress, trauma, bipolar, personality and phobia disorders, psychosis and ASD. 

The contract will be for an initial term of 2 years, with a possible extension of a further one year. 

The substantive/initial financial envelope relates to delivering an indicative volume of 160 MHTRs annually, primarily to Bristol Magistrates Court.

The Commissioner had a maximum financial envelope of £162,500 per annum for this element. 

Services commenced on 01 August 2022.

During the life of the contract, it is likely that the Commissioner will wish to work with the successful provider to 'scale up' the service in order to deliver MHTRs to other Magistrates and Crown Courts across Avon. The additional activity is not guaranteed at this time.

The timing and funding for the scale up will be agreed with the provider based on operational capacity and subject to availability of funding.",,,"South West","85100000 ","Evan Williams",Scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"South Plaza,Marlborough Street",,BRISTOL,BS13NX,England,,,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/ProjectManage/1431 ","The total potential maximum contract value for the 3 year contract (including 1 year extension option and potential scale up) was £780,000.

Further information in regard to the potential 'scale up' of delivery, including indicative activity and budgets, was detailed within the Invitation to Tender document. 

This procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.

The services are healthcare services falling within Schedule 3 to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (""the Regulations""), which are not subject to the full regime of the Regulations, but are instead governed by the ""Light Touch Regime"" contained within Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Regulations (Regulations 74 to 77).",01/08/2022,31/07/2025,21/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,780000,,14/04/2022,318764,"[DEVELOPING HEALTH AND INDEPENDENCE|14 St. James's Parade

The government is committed to improving the delivery of public infrastructure and construction projects, including through more efficient processes and use of materials, greater adoption of technology and innovation, and the development of more effective delivery models with the supply chain. We must also ensure the significant investment in infrastructure and construction is supporting wider policy priorities, such as net zero by 2050 and levelling up. This has been expressed through the National Infrastructure Strategy, Construction Playbook and Transforming Infrastructure Performance: Roadmap to 2030.
The IPA uses its position at the centre of government to drive systemic change and provide expert advice to Ministers on infrastructure and construction policy and delivery. A robust understanding of current project performance is a key enabler for effective policy making and to monitor change over time. To support this, the IPA has worked with colleagues across government and industry to develop the Government Construction Metrics (GCM). 
The GCM span four themes (productivity, levelling up, innovation and net zero) and require projects to report on forecast and actual data across seven metrics for their construction projects. This data is then collated and analysed by the IPA, and over time will create an evidence base for construction policy and delivery that will support continuous improvement and further innovation.",,,"United Kingdom,Isle of Man,Channel Islands,British Oversea Territories,Europe,Rest of the World","72224100 ","Crown Commercial Service on behalf of Cabinet Office : Cabinet Office",supplier@crowncommercial.gov.uk,"Floor 9, The Capital Building, Old Hall Street",,Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,3450103503,https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/crown-commercial-service,"Redacted CCES21A01 - Call Off Order Form.docx Redacted CCES21A01 -  Award Letter.docx Core-Terms-v-3.0.10-v5.odt CCES21A01-Joint-Schedule-1_-Definitions- (1).odt CCES21A01-Joint-Schedule-2_-Variation-Form (1).odt CCES21A01-Joint-Schedule-3_-Insurance-Requirements.odt CCES21A01-Joint-Schedule-5_-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-.odt CCES21A01-Joint-Schedule-6_-Key-Subcontractors.odt Redacted CCES21A01-Joint-Schedule-4-Commercially-Sensitive-Information.odt CCES21A01-Call-Off-Schedule-9_-Security-.odt CCES21A01-Call-Off-Schedule-16_-Benchmarking.odt Redacted CCES21A01-Call-Off-Schedule-4_-Call-Off-Tender-.odt Redacted CCES21A01-Call-Off-Schedule-5_-Pricing-Details-.odt Mott MacDonald - time-only variation (CCES21A01) MM (1) (2).pdf ",,,17/06/2022,04/11/2022,08/03/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,52250,64150,14/04/2022,64150,"[Mott MacDonald Limited|Mott Macdonald House, 8-10 Sydenham Road CR0 2EE Croydon England|NONE||No|No]",,17/06/2022,04/11/2022,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,00:00

Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

Ofcom wish to explore the feasibility of estimating the prevalence of (user generated) online harm for children on platforms which host user generated content including social media, gaming and search engines.

- We are interested in trialling a range of approaches to collecting this data, before we decide how we wish to gather this data in the future. However, we recognise that each approach will require different specialist skills. Consequently, we have split the requirement into three modules. 
Module 1: Undertaking survey research through schools / classrooms
Module 2: Undertaking the research using passive measurement of content viewed on web/ through apps 
Module 3: Other methods (open) to help understand what children see
- Tenderers can submit a proposal for one, two or all three of the modules. Tenderers must be clear within their proposal as to which modules they wish to be considered and evaluated for.  Each module will be evaluated and awarded separately by Ofcom.

We intend to establish a multi-supplier framework for the supply of a wide range of water coolers including associated products and services such as maintenance / sanitisation and consumables such as water bottles and cups.

Tenderers must be able supply, install and maintain both Point of Use (Plumbed in) Water Coolers and Bottled Water Coolers to participate in this Framework.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.

To tender: (a) Go to https://www.eastmidstenders.org/; (b) Register (if not already registered on ProContract); (c) Search for tender opportunity '900_22' (via ""View Opportunities from the 'EastMidsTenders' Portal); (d) Express an interest; (e) Download the tender from the website (documents can be found in the first question of the Online Questionnaire, but to see these you will first need to click on ""Start my response"" followed by ""Edit"" next to the Question set, and ""Answer question"" next to the first question).",,,"United Kingdom","18925000 31141000 39370000 ","Food, Communities and Technology Procurement Team",tenders@espo.org,"Barnsdale Way, Grove Park",Enderby,Leicester,"LE19 1ES","United Kingdom",,http://www.espo.org/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=07ebfca4-097e-ec11-8110-005056b64545 https://www.eastmidstenders.org/ ","As part of the ongoing contract management process, during the period of the Framework Agreement, ESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change to the credit score is identified over the lifetime of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change.  Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.

As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.

Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

This work should describe the features of the various legal structures and what that means for the ability to blend funding from a variety of sources i.e., access public funding, raising capital investment, partaking in ecosystems markets, ability to stack or bundle benefits. 

The research should consider and discuss the implications of the different structures for managing public goods. Specifically: 

How do the structures share risk/liabilities and equity between sectors; what works for environmental public goods and what lessons can we learn from past failures. 

Are there examples of debt-based/repayment models working for environmental public goods? What are the opportunities and risks of debt-based models? 

What is the relationship between purpose and legal structure - what structures are used in common or community ownership models? 

 Numerous examples exist of how partnerships use various corporate structures both within England and internationally, such as projects associated with the Green Recovery Challenge Fund (GRCF), Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF), or those such as Natural Course, Water Resources East (WRE) and WRE's work with The Nature Conservancy on the Norfolk Water Fund, Business Boards associated with Catchment Partnerships (such as the Cameo Partnership), and some of the Test and Trials projects being run under Defra's environmental land management scheme. We are also interested in understanding governance approaches used in other sectors (i.e., energy, digital) that could be transferrable to the environmental sector.  

 Research should be summarised in a report describing the different corporate structures generically and by referencing case studies. It should also include a summary of the learning from different corporate structures used across the case studies to understand what works well where, and at what scale, and whether membership across the public, private and third sector is an essential factor of success. 

 Project Deliverables: 

A report describing the different legal structures, and their pros and cons relating to their ability to blend funding in simple, non-technical language that is accessible for a range of local stakeholders. 

A review and summary of case studies, to include a breakdown of the legal structures, range of partners, and power structures between the different parties. 

Summaries of any interviews held with project managers involved with the case studies. 

Presentation materials summarising the main findings (for example, infographics and/or slide decks with pictures and diagrams).

The team are responsible for ensuring that actions are taken to embed the commitments of the Concordat to Support Research Integrity into the University's research environment and culture by supporting Research Ethics Committee and the Faculty Research Ethics Directors and Departmental Ethics Leads. The team are responsible for ensuring that external approvals via the IRAS system are completed and maintained with appropriate university level authority; undertake institutional audits and support other audits (e.g., safeguarding, health and safety); they provide advice and guidance on using the current Ethics Online System.
      
      A future ethics online approval system must be suitable for use and capable of providing a user-friendly interface for students and staff to make an application for ethical review and obtain ethical clearance for research projects; this should include single sign on via the institutional global address list. The system must be capable of providing a user-friendly system for research ethics committee members to review applications for ethical review and for research administrators to confirm review workflows and conduct audits of applications and review processes. The system must be capable of providing a communications portal allowing multiple information and communication flows between applicants, reviewers and administrators. The system should be flexible and scalable and allow the number of users to be defined by the university and reviewed within the contract period. The number of users is expected to be 3500 applicants per annum and around 150 reviewers per annum within the period.
      
      Four levels of functionality are required: for the applicant to make an application for ethical review; for the review system used by research ethics committee members to review applications, make comments and specify required revisions or to approve applications; for the communication of outcomes of review to the applicant; for system administrators to intervene in an application e.g. review pre-check, return to applicant, or reviewer, terminate.",,,"North East","48900000 48400000 ","Liam Blackie",liam.blackie@northumbria.ac.uk,"Sutherland Building","College Street","Newcastle upon Tyne","NE1 8ST",UK,01912273854,,,"https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=692148277 ",,29/04/2022,30/06/2025,22/04/2022,NO,,No,Yes,No,Products,126195.09,,22/04/2022,126195.09,"[Infonetica Ltd|The Civic Centre

he NHS Long Term Plan published on 7th January 2019 included a new ambition to diagnose three out of four people with cancer at an early stage by 2028. To help deliver on this ambition, the Plan also committed to the extension of Targeted Lung Health Check across England. The programme builds on approaches trialled successfully in Manchester and Liverpool, where 55- to 74-year-olds who currently or had ever smoked were invited for a lung health check, with those identified at high of lung cancer receiving a CT scan to identify possible lung cancers.

St Helens and South Sefton CCGs have now been offered funding to participate in the Programme and have been prioritised based on mortality outcomes from lung cancer. There is an expectation that the first CT scans will be delivered in August 2022.

The potential contract will be valued at approximately £2,299,348* per year; and the contract duration will be for 4 years with the potential to extend for a further 1 x 1-year period. The extension will be subject to further funding being made available to the CCGs.

As a core component to demonstrating the Reactive ISR concept, the work outlined in this requirement will develop the autonomous/AI approaches to understanding what tasks are required to meet a Request for Information (RFI) and the means to determine if a goal has been achieved. Throughout, the wider context of the value of the information must be understood, evaluated, and accounted for. As a result, ISR collection will support much improved understanding. We seek the development of software frameworks, modules and algorithms. 

The work is likely to suit a mixed team made up of academia and industry able to i) determine the state of the art ii) recommend and develop suitable algorithms and information theory iii) implement these solutions into demonstration capability. As part of this research the supplier will be required to develop an interim software framework to form part of a conceptual demonstrator of the Reactive ISR system (in September 2022).

The conceptual demonstrator will look to implement land focused ISR vignettes with the following types of assets: UXVs, manned ariel and land-based platforms, and remote sensing assets. However subsequent demonstrations will look to exercise a wider set of vignettes utilising a mix of assets across different environments.

The five project areas are:
•	Cornwall Coast to Coast
•	Cornwall South and East
•	Devon
•	Somerset
•	Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield

To avoid doubt, Pluss CIC is seeking one supplier to provide evaluation services in all five areas.

An existing evaluation model, developed from the original bid to National Lottery, was split into phases.  Phase one focused on quantitative data, phase two on analysis and phase three the wider aspects of best practice models and social return on investment.  The first and part of the second phases have been completed:
Phase One:
•	Deep dive into existing data; identifying themes and trends
•	In-depth analysis of distance travelled data
•	Informs planning for subsequent phases of research
Phase Two:
•	Quarterly focussed data reviews

The existing model included a range of quantitative and qualitative data gathering tools.
•	Quantitative participant data gathered has been in these categories: expenditure, achievement of outcomes, demographics, education, protected characteristics, and self-declared barriers

      The National Quantum Computing Centre aims at building quantum computers which will be made available to end users. Among others, one of the hardware platforms we are developing is based on trapped ions. In trapped ions quantum computing, lasers are used to interact with the internal states of a single and multiple ions. Depending on the chosen ion species and internal states, specific laser frequencies are used. In order to implement operations with lasers, the lasers need to be permanently frequency stabilised.

The development of skills and independence aims to enable individuals to eventually step down into the NEL supported living service, avoiding high-cost residential and out of area placements in the future. The provision will require a holistic approach to individuals and will be supported by the Multi-Agency Planning (MAP) process to determine individual need, including support, environment, social, boundaries, further education/skills and any other.

The vision is to work closely with a specialist support provider, a housing provider, developer and CCG partners to design an effective and efficient service model and accommodation that meets the requirements within the specification. There will be a requirement as part of the extended  implementation stage to support the design phase to impart specialist knowledge and experience of supporting individuals with complex needs and behaviours that challenge to strengthen the initial concept.

The Contract will be initially set from 1st January 2023 till 31st December 2025 with the possibility of extending the term beyond the initial contracted duration by up to 2 [two] years with mutual agreement from the Provider and NELCCG. This would be dependent on successful achievement of contract outcomes and funding available to support the contract from commissioners.

The supplier will also conduct taxonomic assignment on the metabarcoding data using amplicon sequence variants (preferred) or operational taxonomic units and Blast on a Genbank generated database (or similar).

The Screen and Intervene service will be a key component in a community-based model that will work alongside the new Locally Commissioned Service (LCS) for GP practices and the new Access Facilitator posts (employed by SPFT) in seeking improved physical health outcomes for people suffering from severe mental illness (SMI), who are registered on GP SMI practice registers. 
People living with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) are included on specific General Practice SMI Registers. These are people who have received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or who have experienced an episode of non-organic psychosis. This group face one of the greatest health inequality gaps in England. This new, local service will also help to support NHS capacity constraints and long waiting lists by ensuring an additional community-based service is in place.

Justification for this direct award decision is based on the urgent need to implement, from 1st June 2022, a Screen and Intervene service for people living with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) in West Sussex, which needs to be consistent with the existing models in place in East Sussex and Brighton. Commissioner capacity has been stretched over the last year, which alongside the continued effects of COVID-19 have resulted in a competitive procurement exercise being delayed. 
The service model is well developed from a commissioner perspective and strong and effective partnering arrangements are in place between SHA and the SPFT clinical team, including the SMILES team, and also established PCN-based Wellbeing Services.

Given the imperative to address the current gap in service and the resultant pressures on the wider healthcare system, the decision has been made to directly award, as an interim arrangement, a short-term contract to Southdown Housing Association, pending formal procurement of the future service to commence 1st June 2023. This will allow further time to review the service as proposed and to ensure that the future service, when commissioned, will be complimentary to the ongoing re-development of Emotional and Wellbeing Services. An open procurement exercise will be undertaken during the period of this interim arrangement, to ensure a new longer term contract can be awarded to commence 1st June 2023.",,,"South East","85000000 ","Sarah Rix - Senior Procurement Manager",sarah.rix@soeprocurement.nhs.uk,"Sackville House, Brooks Close (please send any comms electronically to ensure receipt)",,Lewes,"BN7 2FZ","United Kingdom",,,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/soepscommissioning ","The revised LCS model for GP practices will incentivise increased and improved physical health checks for this cohort and place specific reporting requirements on practices. Access Facilitators will work closely with the 40% of individuals on GP SMI practice lists who are engaging least with undertaking their respective physical health checks. They will provide support to increase attendance for this initial health check. 

The Screen and Intervene service will then focus on the physical health concerns that will be raised via the initial physical health check and, provide the ongoing support to the individual to maintain their progress on treatment and recovery plans for health interventions programmes, that have been developed for that person.

Please note: NHS England and Improvement have announced that the Sussex Health and Care Partnership, which is made up of all health and care organisations across East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove, has successfully met the criteria to become an Integrated Care System (ICS). An ICS is a way of working across health and care organisations that allows them to work more closely together, to take collective responsibility of the health and wellbeing of populations across large areas.

It is not anticipated that the statutory responsibility or accountability of the individual health and care organisations working as an ICS will be affected, save for the expectation that CCG organisations will be abolished and functions transferred to the ICS. As a result of these intended healthcare reforms, the Contracting Authorities, currently NHS West Sussex CCG, NHS Brighton and Hove CCG and NHS East Sussex CCG, may change during the life of the contract.
