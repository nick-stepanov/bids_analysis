Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

It consists of the following 4 workstreams, delivered through a multiagency approach between the local authority and third sector partners:
1. Enhanced multi-agency Real-Time Suicide Surveillance (RTSS)
2. System wide training in Safetool safety planning and risk assessment
3. Communications and STOP Suicide Campaigns
4. Understanding and addressing self-harm in children and young people
We are seeking to employ an external evaluation service to evaluate the impact of the Wave 4 suicide transformation project in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. This evaluation needs to consider the impact of each workstream as well as the overall impact of the programme and its multiagency approach. The objective of this evaluation is to inform our future suicide prevention work by determining the effectiveness of our chosen proposals in reducing suicide and improving the awareness of both healthcare professionals and the wider community in suicide prevention skills. In addition, learning can be shared with partners across the East of England region and wider to inform a wider suicide prevention approach nationally. In contrast, evaluation can also reveal areas of improvement that should be considered in future funding proposals.
Evaluation should be both qualitative and quantitative in nature, but there is no expectation of specific evaluation methods from the perspective of the Wave 4 steering group. We are keen to hear potential providers' perspectives on the most appropriate forms of evaluation, and we particularly encourage innovation in your approach. It is important to not only capture the immediate outcomes of our work, but also the long-term impacts that we are hoping to achieve, including behaviour change and greater suicide awareness in both professionals and members of the community.

The tax gap for Income Tax, National Insurance contributions and Capital Gains Tax (IT, NICs and CGT) was 3.5% in 2019 to 2020 at £12.6bn and represents the biggest share of the total tax gap by type of tax. The tax gap is the difference between the amount that should, in theory, be paid to HMRC and what is actually paid. Minimising the tax gap is key to ensuring a fair for all system of tax as well as ensuring that public services can be maintained to an optimum standard.

Making a Difference Every Day' is KCC's innovative approach for Adult Social Care.  We are  taking a bold, exciting approach so that together we can drive consistent, high quality, person-centred and innovative support to those that need it.  Technology Enables Care is key to the success of this new approach and  is critical to the Authority's vision for the social care and health landscape in Kent to harness the positive impact digital technology can have to enable independent living and optimise a person's outcomes whilst reducing the demand for care and support.

For a period of 12 months, the build and test model will operate across a proposed three of KCC's 12 districts. The learning and data captured will help inform a Kent wide digital solution.

Using a restricted procedure, KCC is seeking to appoint an agnostic technology provider where different types of technology can best test with real life assessments. The chosen provider will be required to collate data and work with a network of internal Digital Facilitators and Digital Champions to build a specification that will be used to inform sourcing a longer-term solution.

In the first instance Providers interested in this opportunity review the enclosed Specification and if appropriate should express their interest via the Kent Business Portal by 12th November 2021.  KCC is particularly interested in those Providers who can demonstrate their experience with supporting other Local Authorities.

The primary objectives of the contract are to achieve sustainable outcomes for rough sleepers and a reduction in numbers.

Assertive outreach engages pro-actively with rough sleepers encouraging moves into appropriate housing for safety, well-being and recovery. Routes off the street are supported by joint working and collaborative case planning. If someone refuses assistance or no route is identified, outreach teams are assertive - persistent and positive - continuing to engage and offer the right support until an offer is accepted or a suitable exit route found. 

We are seeking a provider with a track record of providing trauma informed and person-centred rough sleeper outreach services.

The awarded provider will be flexible and innovative in their approach to meet the needs of rough sleepers across the Dorset Council area, identifying people in rural locations where people tend to be more hidden, hostels and temporary accommodation absent, travel distances significant and public transport lacking, while ensuring cover is available for the inevitable peaks of rough sleepers in the summer months, particularly in coastal areas. 

The appointed contractor will maintain established outreach services and TUPE staff from the existing provider where applicable.

The contract period will be from 01 April 2022 to 31 March 2024, with two options to extend of 12 months each making a total potential contract period of 4 years.

1. Document the baseline before the PNA programme
2. Evaluate the PNA model
3. Assess the usefulness of using one or all elements of the model and the perceived impact and outcomes
4. Restorative clinical supervision - evaluation specifically of the perceived benefits.

These are stand-alone packages, which have been presented here as options to allow choices for the supplier, other delivery options can be incorporated into the tender document. The potential for linkages and interdependencies between these work-packages has been described but is not exhaustive.

We would expect the research commission to include interviews and focus groups with individuals to see if different fields of practice have different experiences, and if the programme works better in some settings than others.

The evaluation will be theory-driven throughout; all evaluation activities will incorporate elements to develop and refine a programme theory. This process will explicate the role of programme implementation activities and describe assumptions about how these are intended to achieve specific intermediate and distal outcomes.

Dr Arnold Emerson was appointed as the first superintendent and in 1980 after modernisation, the ECT was renamed in recognition of his 30-year contribution. Since 1980 the ECT has continued to see investment in its operating system and data acquisition. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Particle Image Velocimeter (PIV) systems have enabled precise and non-disruptive measurements of water velocity to directly measure the boundary layer and turbulence in the flow. The ECT control system was last updated in 2008 by Cussons Technology Ltd. Since then, Cussons has gone into administration leaving the old and dated control system with no technical support.
