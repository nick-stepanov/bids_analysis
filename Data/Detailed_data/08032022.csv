The framework will be available for use by the following commissioners:\\\\r\\r\r

Brief Description of Requirement

Innovate UK EDGE through its national network of 20 consortium partners runs a large number of conferences and events each year, and this is an area of increasing demand. We provide the capability for our partners to book meetings at face-to-face and virtual events (e.g. allowing attendees to book 1-on-1 sessions with the speakers after an event/webinar has finished).

At the minimum we require a tool to broker meetings, to enable continuity of this essential service for us and our partners. It could be part of a larger event platform with full virtual event hosting capability. Ideally, the solution will also be able to integrate with our Salesforce CRM for seamless data entry.

As IUK EDGE organises several high-profile events each year it is critical that these events are hosted, or at the minimum that meetings are brokered, on a GDPR / DPIA compliant platform that provides the functionality and professionalism that is expected. Therefore, enhancing IUK EDGE's reputation whilst minimising any GDPR / DPIA related risks. 

Consequently, Innovate UK EDGE is looking to purchase a user-friendly tool to broker meetings which is GDPR / DPIA compliant and is provided by the supplier as Software as a Service. It could be part of a cloud-based Event Platform which is GDPR / DPIA compliant and is provided by the supplier as Software as a Service and is also available as a Managed Service should event demand require Innovate UK EDGE to secure additional resource and support. It is desirable that any platform must be able to adapt and support future event demand as it is expected that in future due to the pandemic that EDGE will increasingly host hybrid events combining virtual and physical event attendance.

The Council is looking to commission a multi-disciplinary team to help set an ambitious vision for such proposals and to ingrain high quality place making outcomes from the outset of the process.  This includes focusing on the delivery issues and infrastructure requirements associated with each proposal which, due to the scale and extent of the proposals, is considered to require more detailed assessment.

SMC-2122-35,Contract,"Social Mobility Commission",Awarded,2022-06-24T19:41:47+01:00,"Opportunity to be an Expert Adviser on the Social Mobility Commission's Policy and Evidence Advisory Panel","The Social Mobility Commission (SMC) monitors progress towards improving social mobility in the UK and promotes social mobility in England. It is an independent statutory body. 

The SMC is establishing a Policy and Evidence Advisory Panel of subject-matter experts to provide advice on a range of issues that impact social mobility:

Academic roles:
1.	Education (Lot 1)
2.	Measurement (quantitative analysis) (Lot 2)
3.	Routes to employment and the labour market (Lot 3)
4.	Families expert (Lot 4)

Policy roles:
5.	Education (schools) (Lot 5)
6.	Education (further education) (Lot 6)
7.	Families expert (Lot 7)
8.	Levelling up - geographic/ place inequalities (Lot 8)

The panel will consist of both academic leaders in their field as well as seasoned policy experts. The panel will consist of both academic leaders in their field as well as seasoned policy experts. 

The final number of experts recruited will depend on the quality of bids received and budget considerations but is expected to be approximately 8 individuals.

Being an expert on the Policy and Evidence Advisory Panel provides a unique opportunity to help shape the SMC's mission of improving social mobility for all.  We intend to use advice arising from this contract to inform our thinking - we do not expect suppliers to engage on our behalf.

A key task will be to review and provide input into the Social Mobility Commission's annual statutory report, The State of the Nation.  This is laid before Parliament each year.  In 2022 we expect to launch the report in April, so this will be one of the Panel's first tasks.  On a more ongoing basis, we will request panel members to be a sounding board for us - on our research pipeline, our policy recommendations, as well as when we are scoping new areas that may have causal links to social mobility.  

Anyone holding a role on the panel will not be excluded from bidding for future contracts offered by the SMC. Nor will holding a role on the panel provide anyone with any advantages in being considered for future bids for SMC contracts. To avoid a conflict of interest, experts on the panel would not be expected to advise on work they have been separately contracted by the SMC to do. In this case, we would aim to allocate experts to work where there is no such conflict of interest.   

Length of Bids
A.	Bids should not exceed a total of 2 pages per role (excluding CV, publications list, declarations/annex).
a.	Any bids above that will not be considered. The font size should not be smaller than 11. Embedded links or files will not be considered.
B.	Bidders must also please complete and submit the 'Declarations' (Document 5).
C.	Bidders must also complete and submit the 'Conflict of Interest' (Annex One).

Bidders must submit their Bids before 12 Noon on Monday 14 February 2022, to: Colin.Seymour@cabinetoffice.gov.uk.

The purpose of this research was two-fold, Firstly, to determine whether consumers and industry would be willing to make use of reservation agreements and then secondly and only providing that Kantar could demonstrate industry and consumer support,  for Kantar to carry out a trial of reservation agreements. Once this trial had been concluded, Government could then make a determination about an appropriate way forward.

Kantar successfully completed the first phase of their research carrying out research with industry and consumers. At the start of 2020, they submitted a report to MHCLG (now DLUHC) which summarised their findings and recommended that the work should proceed to a formal trial. In early March 2020, Ministers agreed that this work should proceed to a trial. However, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the housing market and then the subsequent recovery sparked by a stamp duty holiday distorted the level of transactions and meant that a trial during 2020 was not possible.

Brief Description of Requirement
The aim of this procurement will be to procure a data architecture specialist to produce a report setting out clear options for delivering a sustainable and coherent national Earth Observation data architecture concept for the UK.

2021-538,Contract,"DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT FOOD & RURAL AFFAIRS",Awarded,2022-03-22T12:55:39Z,"Strategic Review for dairy genetic evaluations","AHDB is seeking a supplier, or consortium, able to perform a strategic review of the way AHDB's dairy genetic and genomic evaluation services are currently structured and financed and explore potential alternative models to ensure future excellence.

Dairy genetic and genomic evaluation services are operated by AHDB to ensure impartial assessments of dairy animals from around the world and rate them on their genetic qualities, which are specifically tailored to UK needs.

We recognise however that due to technological developments and structural breeding industry changes this may no longer be the only appropriate model. The delivery outputs of the current structure are limited not only by financial resource constraints, but also the availability of skilled people to undertake development work demanded by industry. In addition, the skill sets required to offer the services changes at a fast pace. We want to build and retain capacity and knowledge to ensure long term success of our activities.

An important element for the success of a potentially new or improved structure is the co-operation from the main stakeholders in the evaluation process and buy-in from the wider dairy sector. The supplier therefore must consider this as part of the review.
The following elements are required from the review into the Structure, Governance and Finance;

1)	To review the current structure and finance of the UK dairy genetic and genomic evaluation services
2)	To review and contrast the structure and finance in a number of other countries 
3)	Consultation with several stakeholders on their view of current service delivery and their future expectation
4)	Consideration to the impact on Beef & Sheep evaluations financed by AHDB
5)	To propose best structure, governance, and finance to secure future service delivery and ongoing developments of genetic and genomic evaluation to the AHDB board for consideration.
i.	This is to be delivered as a written report, and will be followed by a meeting to discuss the outcomes with the AHDB executive.

The primary objectives of the contract are to achieve sustainable outcomes for rough sleepers and a reduction in numbers.

Assertive outreach engages pro-actively with rough sleepers encouraging moves into appropriate housing for safety, well-being and recovery. Routes off the street are supported by joint working and collaborative case planning. If someone refuses assistance or no route is identified, outreach teams are assertive - persistent and positive - continuing to engage and offer the right support until an offer is accepted or a suitable exit route found. 

We are seeking a provider with a track record of providing trauma informed and person-centred rough sleeper outreach services.

The awarded provider will be flexible and innovative in their approach to meet the needs of rough sleepers across the Dorset Council area, identifying people in rural locations where people tend to be more hidden, hostels and temporary accommodation absent, travel distances significant and public transport lacking, while ensuring cover is available for the inevitable peaks of rough sleepers in the summer months, particularly in coastal areas. 

The appointed contractor will maintain established outreach services and TUPE staff from the existing provider where applicable.

The contract period will be from 01 April 2022 to 31 March 2024, with two options to extend of 12 months each making a total potential contract period of 4 years.

Background
AWRP is a strategic asset that receives and processes up to 320,000 tonnes of waste each year, and is a key component of the Council's long-term waste and environment strategy. Comprising of a Mechanical Treatment Facility, Anaerobic Digester and Energy from Waste Plant, the site improves recycling capabilities, generates 28MW of electricity and produces 70,000 tonnes of aggregate used in the construction sector. 

The project is a collaboration between the City of York Council and North Yorkshire County Council. AWRP has been operational since 1 March 2018. 

The Government published its Resources and Waste Strategy for England in December 2018 which sets out how the Government will preserve material resources by minimising waste, promoting resource efficiency, and moving towards a circular economy in England. This was followed up by three consultations in 2019 and a fourth in 2020:
•	Consistency in Household and Business Recycling Collections.
•	Reforming the UK Packaging Producer Responsibility System.
•	Introducing a Deposit Return Scheme. 
•	Consultation on the Waste Management Plan. 

The Strategy and subsequent consultations could have a potentially significant impact on the PPP Contract and the operations at AWRP. The Council is seeking support from the Supplier about how best to navigate these reforms and undertake required changes to the PPP Contract.",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","79100000 ","Procurement Team",procurement@northyorks.gov.uk,"County Hall,Racecourse Lane",,NORTHALLERTON,DL78AD,England,"01609 533450",,,,,14/03/2022,13/03/2024,28/02/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,300000,,04/03/2022,300000,"[Ashfords LLP|Ashford House

We expect the supplier to:

•	Design a research specification for the project that will identify the requisite approach to participant identification, sampling and data weighting, as well as determining and describing guidelines on how data can be collected (as well as what will not be permissible)
•	Produce research materials and guidance in accordance with the research specification, including:
o	Validated surveys questions
o	Templates of invitation and reminder texts, designed to maximise response rates, while also fulfilling information governance requirements
o	Additional materials, or different formats of existing materials, as required to support inclusivity
•	Provide technical support to ICSs as they administer the data collection in accordance with the guidance: due to the standard nature of the groups to be included in the Integration Index, the standard questions and method of asking them, we expect much of this support will be consistent across ICSs and that the need for responsive support will therefore be limited
•	A review, and potential update, of the research approach and materials in light of lessons learnt from the first year of roll-out

The supplier will also be expected to attend certain advisory groups, engage in testing and development, and provide technical support to ICSs. This will pertain to advising ICSs and/or their data collection suppliers on their application of the research guidance and use of the research materials. 

We are therefore seeking to procure a supplier that has top class expertise in social research methods and is therefore well suited to advise on, and design, survey materials.

1. Document the baseline before the PNA programme
2. Evaluate the PNA model
3. Assess the usefulness of using one or all elements of the model and the perceived impact and outcomes
4. Restorative clinical supervision - evaluation specifically of the perceived benefits.

The potential for linkages and interdependencies between these work-packages has been described but is not exhaustive.

We would expect the research commission to include interviews and focus groups with individuals to see if different fields of practice have different experiences, and if the programme works better in some settings than others.

The evaluation will be theory-driven throughout; all evaluation activities will incorporate elements to develop and refine a programme theory.
