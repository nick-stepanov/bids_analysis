Works will be delivered under a TPC 2005 (as amended) for a maximum of 10 years: which will run for an initial period of 5 years with the option to extend by up to a further 5 years. Customer care excellence and high customer satisfaction is at the heart of our repair service. The successful implementation of ICT is one of the key drivers for the successful delivery of the Responsive Repairs and Void service with the continued development of systems through the life of the contract. Our requirement is split into geographical Lots as detailed below;
Lot 1 - East Region 
Lot 2 - South Region
Lot 3 - West Region
Longhurst Group are looking to let a long term partnership contract covering responsive repairs and voids over its 3 geographical regions and 20,000+ properties.The scope is broken into 3 areas for all Lots:
1. Core scope - Responsive Repairs and Voids - £13M per annum
a. The core scope of the contract is strictly for the delivery of repairs and voids (core scope) - customers are at the heart of everything the Group does and as such the Group are looking for partners who can deliver operational and customer service excellence.The contract will be let on this basis and these works will form the only exclusive works from day 1 of the contract.
2. Additional scope - Electrical Testing and Repairs, Asbestos Testing & Remedials, Fire Safety Works, Legionella Testing & Remedials, Kitchens and Bathrooms - £5M per annum - this scope will be tested with bidders during dialogue in order to understand the benefit of potentially including from contract year 2 onwards.
3. Further opportunities - to understand possible opportunities for widening and/or deepening the scope of the contract from contract year 3 - £5M per annum.
a. Longhurst Group have implemented ambitious strategies to address the key challenges of our time in this sector - housing crisis, decarbonisation, social inequality and the environment. As a result, we are actively looking for our key strategic partners to help the implementation of these strategies and would potentially consider widening the breadth and depth of relationships with our partners during the course of the contract based on the right conditions. 
Please note that points 2 and 3 above are not guaranteed or exclusive and will not form the scope of the contract to be awarded for day 1.

The service provided will meet the gap in the Acute Frailty Service (AFS) programme by providing a link between the client and the health and social care professionals and help address people's difficulties in navigating health and social care systems. The Care Navigator service will continue to build on the positive experience of working within health and social care multidisciplinary team to support vulnerable clients with complex needs and reduce demand for health and social care services by linking a Care Navigator to the AFS to help prevent hospital readmissions. The Service will aim to support over 100 clients per year.

The Care Navigator will be responsible for:

• Carrying out person-centred conversations with the person about their needs, wishes and preferences helping to identify their goals and co-produce a holistic care plan of support.

• Providing information/advice to individuals about a range of services to promote health and wellbeing and maintain independence within communities.

• Facilitate access to services available in the community including introducing clients to new activities and motivating them to have an active role in the community.

This support will include providing information/advice to individuals about a range of services and facilitating access to services in the community to maximise independence and wellbeing. E.g. income maximisation checks with benefits applications, transport assistance (including Blue Badge, Dial-a-Ride and other transport options) and support networks to reduce isolation, build a network of support and enhance quality of life. This may include accessing befriending and support groups, opportunities to keep fit and exercise, access to carer support including carer assessments, accessing day centres, etc.

The service aims to:

• Support people with multiple long-term conditions to self-manage ensuring they have maximum support at home, enabling choices and access to services in the community to achieve the best possible quality of life and independence.

• Support integration of services across health, social care and voluntary sectors.

The UK had been covered by the EU's Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing regulations (1005/2008). These regulations are retained in UK law but the UK has the freedom to set its own policies and regulations on IUU. 

The UK's status as an independent coastal state provides an opportunity to better understand how IUU fishing affects the UK. Better understanding this will influence policy development to tackle IUU fishing. The financial cost and environmental, economic, and social impact of IUU fishing on UK industry has not yet been quantified.

In 2021 Defra commissioned a systematic review, which identified, reviewed and critiqued existing literature of the impacts of IUU fishing and how they relate to the UK. A copy is attached to this ITT. The review found that the information currently available regarding IUU activities impacting the UK is primarily based on large scale estimates (often global) of both volume and cost, or is derived from low sample-size studies which often lack statistical robustness.",,"SW1P 3JR",London,"03000000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"Nobel House, 17 Smith Square",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolutions.co.uk,"ecm_64884 RandD Terms - IUU Fishing  Quantifying the costs of IUU fishing to the UK__Redacted.pdf ",,,16/05/2022,16/09/2022,28/03/2022,YES,tender_296037/1046245,Yes,Yes,No,Services,36595,,05/04/2022,36595,"[MRAG Ltd|18 Queen Street, London.

They provide a mixture of school residentials and accommodation for private groups and operate year-round including Christmas and bank holidays. Bedding is provided for all groups and this has always been laundered by contract as there is no laundry facility on the sites.

The centres require a reliable, flexible laundry service including collection and drop off that can operate without disruption in poor weather (Hagg Farm's position on the Snake Rd in particular can lead to challenges of access for large vehicles in the winter). The service needs to be responsive as bookings are often scheduled at the last minute and due to the very limited amount of bedding that we own, we would need to arrange laundry at short notice to turn around for subsequent groups.

3169.538.JS.NAMRC.21,Contract,"UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD",Awarded,2022-05-27T13:02:52+01:00,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for Research and Development","The Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC) is one of seven high value manufacturing catapult centres promoting advanced manufacturing technologies and serving the UK supply chain, mainly in the nuclear sector. Further information about the NAMRC can be found at the following website -  https://namrc.co.uk/.
The NAMRC's Controls and Instrumentation Group is looking for a supplier to supply, deliver, train its staff and maintain a fully integrated, fully mounted, ready to fly, multi-purpose Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for various activities including surveying, intelligence, reconnaissance, inspection and 3D mapping within a variety of industrial and research applications. 
The primary role of the UAV will be for precise external inspections (and potentially internal inspections so ""return home""/failsafe and the ability to navigate in enclosed spaces would be useful) thus will require high-resolution video transmission to the remote controller.
As well being used in the nuclear industry, there is potential for the UAV to be used in the aerospace, construction, earthmoving an mining, marine, oil and gas (on & offshore), rail, wind, tidal, solar and biomass industries for a wide range of industrial applications such as:-
•	Small Modular Reactor (SMR) site assembly - civil modular concrete slab inspection;
•	SMR manufacturing- Mechanical Electrical and Plumbing  (MEP) modules inspection;
•	Reduction in requirement for operators working at height;
•	Inspection on Dismantling & Decommissioning site;
•	Inspection (for abnormal operation, failure, cracks & corrosion) of offshore wind farms (harsh environment high winds, rain, salt water etc.);
•	Saves reducing reactor power for human inspection;
•	Condition and security monitoring for sites left in care and maintenance;
•	Remote inspection of welds, e.g., on the dome of the SMR;
•	Assess areas with other hazards, post nuclear accident or chemical spills for example.

Due to the wide variety of potential industrial applications we are looking for a relatively compact system (albeit we appreciate there is a compromise between size, payload and flight/hover times) that is quick and easy to assemble and disassemble, and that when disassembled and packed in its storage/carry case will fit into the boot of a medium sized car for easy transportation.

DSTL/AGR/SERAPIS/SSE/39,Contract,"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory",Awarded,2022-05-09T09:58:50+01:00,"TRED Simulation, Environment, Data and API","For Dstl and specifically the Defence AI Centre Experimentation Hub (DAIC-X) delivery team for concept 1 there is a requirement to showcase and demonstrate AI-services that control a platform with stealthy behaviour as well as having the ability to react accordingly to a dynamic scenario to enable future exploitation of the AI-services involved by the [REDACTED] project. This behaviour is to be referred to as being ""threat aware"". The first step is to utalise a simulated environment that will allow for ideas to be developed and experimended with in a safe and cost effective manner. A previous [REDACTED] simulated environment, developed by [REDACTED] , was used 
to act as a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration where real-time performance of solutions could be tested and proved for an un-crewed air vehicle (UAV) before proceeding to trials. This existing simulation environment is a 
suitable starting point to be able to generate AI-enabled ""threat aware"" behaviour, but there is a requirement to add to and adjust its current capabilities in order to be effective.

With the understanding that development of this dynamic ""threat aware"" behaviour has already begun the requirements for this work comes in two stages which allow for access to the initial environment, terrain data and 
Python API in stage 1 and an updated/refined versions in stage 2. The requirement for each element have been detailed below.
Terrain Data:
To allow for an efficient and iterative approach to developing the concept, the delivery team require accurate and representative data to be provided/accessible that will act as a conduit to deploying an AI-service trained in early stages to be able to perform well in the full simulation environment (for further details see The Unity Environment section). The data will be required to contain environment terrain information to include at least the height and type of the terrain, natural elements and man-made structures. This will be able to be used in conjunction with the delivery team's own risk-maps in order to train AI algorithms to be able to complete a mission whilst being ""threat aware"".
Python API: The Python API that is designed to be used in the final delivery of the simulation should be provided so that development of the AI-services can progress in the direction of the future simulation software, allowing for an easier transition between Stage 1 and Stage 2 deliverables as the environment gets updated. The API should include config and a post mission report formats. This will allow for the delivery team to configure suitable experiments and provide information for further analysis on the missions, timestamped location data should be accessible for all of the entities within the environment.

It is formed from 15 kDa monomers that produce robust, flexible polymers up to 2 µm in length.

We aim to create a spinout company that will initially produce Caf1 polymers and coated plasticware/microcarriers for the 2D cell culture market, predominantly focussed on laboratory research, expanding into commercial companies looking to scale up cell production. The Newcastle-based company will supply these products directly to customers, and through marketing partners who have established distribution networks.

We are looking for a CEO/COO/Chairperson to work alongside Daniel Peters to develop a business plan that has considered the best market strategy for Caf1 in preparation for spinout formation and achieving the necessary fundraising.

The initial brief of the executive will be to:
(1) Work with the existing team to lead in the creation of a viable 5 year business plan;
(2) Obtain university approval for the venture;
(3) a. Act for the company in the spin-out legal process and address all company formation matters;
b. Obtain founder academics' and Newcastle University (including the Head of Company Creation) approval for appointment as CEO or agreed post supporting Daniel Peters
c. Provide to the appropriate university all matters necessary for Research England reporting requirements;
(4) Leading and work alongside the existing team to secure start up funding (venture capital and other) funding
Stage (5) will produce the funds by which the new start-up company can consider employing the executive going forward. It is expected, and the intent of the scheme, that the Executive will remain with the business following the end of the contract period. However, such appointment will be at the discretion of the board and appropriate university and will be subject to confirmation, typically at Stage 4 above",,,"North East","79400000 ","Natalie Morton",natalie.morton@ncl.ac.uk,"Newcastle University","Procurement Services, Kingsgate",Newcastle,"NE1 7RU","United Kingdom","'+44 1912086396",https://www.ncl.ac.uk,,,,25/04/2022,30/09/2022,16/03/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,30000,30000,12/04/2022,29500,"[KWWK Ltd|Brunel House 340 Firecrest Court,

The role of commissioning is to help build the right services around people in order to make a difference to their health and care outcomes. To do this requires a commitment to putting people first, by understanding the population, their strengths and assets as well as their needs and aspirations, both now and in the future. To achieve our vision, we plan with people, and our organisational partners, to make the most effective use of local resources and develop solutions to continuously deliver high-quality person-centred care. Within the backdrop of the Covid 19 pandemic, we need to understand the impact it has had on our citizens and the services they receive.
      
      The Council requires a co-production partner to lead on the development and implementation, with support from co-production volunteers and the Council commissioning officers, of the review described above. 
      
      The review is expected to be delivered in four stages:
      
      Stage one: Plan programme for subsequent stages of the programme - April/May 2022
      Stage two: Recruitment and training of co-production participants - August 2022
      Stage three: Review of day opportunities September/October 2022
      Stage four: Report of co-produced review November 2022
      
      It is anticipated that the four stages will be completed in full over circa 60 delivery days.

The ESN will deliver integrated critical voice and broadband data services to all three emergency services (3ES) and other users throughout GB (England, Wales and Scotland). These services require a mobile communications network capable of providing the full coverage, resilience, security and public safety functionality required by the 3ES. The ESN will replace those services delivered under current service contract(s). A number of these service contracts operate across the 3ES and other users. The new service contracts were awarded during 2015 to facilitate commencement of service delivery from late 2016 as existing service contracts begin to expire. The procurement is divided into 3 Lots with associated Related Projects.

This Contract Award Notice is with regard to a Contract awarded to one of the incumbent Suppliers of Control Room systems (as deployed to the UK 3ES customers) to develop a compatible ICCS product upgrade that enables the Supplier's control room ICCS product(s) to interface to ESN. The development is to commence with integration for the minimum subset of Kodiak 9.0 and 9.1 features as set out in the Technical Requirements, with a subsequent CCN to migrate to Kodiak 10 and then potentially other future releases as necessary to support the delivery of ESN.

2)	A report setting out analysis of the proposed indicators for the Funding Formula (listed below), what it means for the City of London Police, identification of any missing indicators and an evidence base for what factors need to be considered given the Force's national responsibilities, capital city status and uniqueness. This should also explore what indicators should be considered for online fraud and cyber demand. The current proposed indications for the formula are:
o	Uniqueness of the City of London 
o	High-cost base
o	Inability to leverage council tax precept due to low resident population
o	Significant terrorist target due to the iconic nature of the City
o	A growing night-time economy and leisure destination (Destination City)
o	High density, transient population including workers and tourists
o	National responsibilities for fraud
o	Importance of factoring online crime demand into the formula 

Timeline

Due to the timing of the Police Funding Review, this work needs to be carried out at pace and we would require someone to begin this work from the beginning of April and deliver the outputs by no later than Friday 13th May 2022. We envisage that it would take 20 working days to deliver this work.",,,London,"79000000 ","Emma Cunnington",emma.cunnington@cityoflondon.police.uk,"City of London Police HQ","Guildhall Yard East",LONDON,"EC2V 5AE",England,07561173974,,,,,11/04/2022,13/05/2022,06/04/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,40000,,11/04/2022,40000,"[CREST ADVISORY (UK) LIMITED|2, BATH PLACE

      Reference: SMBC 21197 A
      
      Sandwell MBC has secured funding for habitat survey work and it is the intention to commission this work from ecological consultants who are familiar with the sub-region or who have undertaken work in areas similar to Sandwell / the Black Country. Consultants are invited to submit a fee proposal for the work, which will consist of one work package addressing a series of sites in a single contract.
      The aims of the survey work are as follows:
      o to establish baseline data for Local Sites within the proposed growth network. Sites outside these areas which are likely to be impacted by the growth network have also been selected;
      o to identify the presence of significant species and habitats to inform development proposals;
      o to evaluate the quality of the sites;
      o to identify appropriate management objectives to ensure the sites remain in optimal condition;
      o to add to the ecological knowledge of the Black Country sub-region and to update the ecological records held by the four authorities.
      The survey work will target candidate sites; a schedule of sites is appended to this brief at Appendix 1.
      The standard of assessment must be sufficient to fulfil the stated aims of the survey work set out above. It must be rigorously carried out to justify formal designation of sites and robust enough to be defensible during planning appeals. It is therefore important that the sites are assessed in the context of the Birmingham and Black Country landscape using accepted methodologies. Further guidance and information are provided in Appendix 4.
