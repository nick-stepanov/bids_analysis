DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

BEIS places significance importance on having high quality monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activity across the Department. BEIS has created a M&E hub to oversee and support M&E across BEIS alongside a number of M&E experts/teams that are embedded alongside policy teams. BEIS's M&E Framework outlines BEIS' vision for comprehensive, proportionate, good quality monitoring and evaluation across the department and its partner organisations. The aims of this contract contribute to the delivery of that vision.

To support the work of the M&E hub, it is necessary for teams across BEIS to have access to specialist M&E expertise at various points in the project lifecycle. This detailed support is beyond the resources of the M&E Hub itself.

The M&E Hub have identified that the best solution for this is for the M&E hub to commission, and own, a call-off contract which BEIS teams can access. This would allow BEIS teams to efficiently commission expert support without needing to go through an external commissioning process, while also ensuring that they are supported in this area by working with a contractor who has expertise in delivering these tasks. This contract is not intended to replace the stand-alone commissioning of contracts to deliver policy evaluations.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the RFP document.

This follows the publication of the Government's Levelling Up White Paper in February 2022 which sets out proposals to broaden and deepen devolution across the country.

The four D2N2 authorities submitted a joint bid to Government on 25 March 2022 following the announcement that Derbyshire and Derby and Nottinghamshire and Nottingham were being considered as pathfinder county areas. The joint bid to Government builds on earlier D2 and N2 County Deal expressions of interest and proposals.

The Government has indicated that it will be taking forward a number of devolution deals as part of a first phase of pathfinder areas by Autumn 2022. The opportunity to be included in the first phase of areas to secure a devolution deal presents a significant opportunity to secure powers and funding for the delivery of enhanced outcomes for the people of Derbyshire and Derby, Nottinghamshire and Nottingham. A previous attempt at securing a devolution deal (in 2016) was unsuccessful. Over time this has led to significant underinvestment with the area and wider East Midlands region falling behind its neighbours in Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and the West Midlands. The Deal is likely to be the first stage on a journey in securing much needed additional powers, flexibilities and funding. Areas that have secured devolution deals in the past have received funding packages of between £450m and £1.1bn over a thirty-year period.


D2N2 Councils are now seeking consultancy services to maximise the opportunities presented. Once areas have formally been confirmed, timescales for taking forward proposals are likely to be extremely tight. Additional support and capacity, to be in place from 1 June 2022, is therefore required to ensure D2/N2 Councils can meet the Government's indicative Autumn 2022 timetable

"CPU 5383",Contract,"Nottingham City Council",Awarded,2022-07-25T14:25:58+01:00,"Changing Futures - Advocacy Service","Introduction
The Nottingham City Integrated Care Partnership has successfully bid for national funding as part of the Government's Changing Futures (CF) programme. This short-term programme, to the end of March 2024, will provide specialist services, partnership delivery models and develop system change in order to achieve better outcomes for people who experience the most significant Severe Multiple Disadvantage (SMD). SMD is defined within the programme as affecting people who experience at least 3 of 5 forms of disadvantage:
• Homelessness
• Substance misuse
• Mental ill-health
• Domestic and sexual abuse
• Interaction with the criminal justice system.
The Changing Futures Programme is commissioned by Nottingham City Council, in partnership with Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group.
The objective of the CF programme is to ensure that people living in Nottingham City who experience SMD receive joined up, flexible, person-centred care from the right services, at the right time, and in the right place to meet their needs. The focus of the programme is on achieving system change to enable the development and delivery of joined up services that provide effective healthcare, support and other forms of assistance to the most excluded, marginalised and vulnerable individuals who experience SMD. Partnership working is integral to delivering the CF programme and achieving the ambitions for system change.

The Main Delivery Service will encompass:
• Frontline Delivery Team
• Lived Experience Team
• Peer Mentors
• Activities Coordination
• Insight and Development Hub
• Practice Development Unit
• SMD specialist roles embedded within key partner agencies
• Housing Led Support Team

This independent advocacy service (the Service) will be available to beneficiaries of the Changing Futures Programme to support them to make and manage complaints, concerns or grievances (an Issue) in relation to any services they are entitled to covered by the Programme. This may be the Changing Futures Main Delivery Service, housing services, criminal justice services, domestic abuse services, sexual abuse services, recovery providers, training providers or any other relevant provision.

Aims of the Service
• To resolve Issues that people in Nottingham who experience SMD have with relevant services through the provision of an Independent Advocacy Service.
• To ensure that beneficiaries' experience influences the development and delivery of the Changing Futures Programme and associated service providers as a response to the issues raised through the advocacy service.
The key aim of this service is to enable current and future beneficiaries to access services that meet their needs.
By working with individuals, monitoring incidents of dissatisfaction, their causes and resolutions, the Programme will be able to influence change within its own services and those of other provider organisations.",,"NG2 3NG",,"85300000 ","Tin-Chi Lee",tin-chi.lee@nottinghamcity.gov.uk,"Loxley House,Station Street",,NOTTINGHAM,NG23NG,England,07927965409,,,,,01/07/2022,31/03/2024,01/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,78750,,22/06/2022,78750,"[Pohwer|Hertlands House

The National Quantum Computing Centre is funded through the UKRI, and is dedicated to accelerating the development of quantum computing by addressing the challenges of scaling - technological and user adoption. It seeks to enhance the UK's global leadership in quantum computing, to help translate UK research strengths into innovation, and enable the creation of the first generation of quantum computers, helping to build a resilient future economy. 
      
      The National Quantum Computing Centre aims at building quantum computers which will be made available to end users, and is pursuing two primary platforms of quantum computing, one based on superconductors and one based on trapped ions, as these are currently the most mature.
      
      In trapped ions quantum computing, lasers are used to interact with the internal states of a single and multiple ions. Depending on the chosen ion species and internal states, specific laser frequencies are used. In order to implement operations with lasers, the lasers need to be permanently frequency stabilised.
      
      The standard way to achieve the required stability is to reference each laser to a pair of mirrors - which form a cavity. The distance between the mirrors is fixed in length and can be made to be stable enough to act as the required reference. Further information regarding the mirrors can be found within Section 3 of the Specification.

In the worst cases, water crossed the threshold to such a depth that residents were forced to evacuate their homes. As the flood waters rose some residents were left to live upstairs or seek alternative accommodation.

As Lead Local Flood Authority, Solihull MBC produced a Section 19 Flood Report in line with Flood Risk Regulations. As a result of the Section 19 report, initial investigations were carried out which determined that property level resilience measures would be a suitable option for providing additional protection to those residents that suffered internal flooding.

Since this time, a Flood Investigation Report (here) was approved by the Cabinet Member for Environment and Highways on 6th October 2021 for the progression of this scheme and thereafter a business case has been developed and the external funding secured from the Environment Agency and the Trent Regional Flood and Coastal Committee.",,"B91 3QB",,"45246400 ",,dan.sharp@solihull.gov.uk,"Council House","Manor square",SOLIHULL,"B91 3QB",England,,,,,,26/06/2022,31/03/2024,30/05/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1495500,,16/06/2022,1495500,"[Watertight International|Saxon Business Park

Please consider the information contained in this document and any associated attachments. If your organisation will have the resource and capacity for delivering this service, and wishes to be considered for tendering, please respond as instructed below. 

After assessing the EOI /Supplier Selection Stage responses, the University will shortlist suppliers and invite them to participate in the closed Invitation to Tender (ITT) stage. Following the ITT stage, Lancaster University proposes to award the contract to a single supplier.

The University operates an energy monitoring system (EMS) consisting of more than 1,200 electricity, gas, water and heat meters. The vast majority of meters are located at the University's Bailrigg campus (LA1 4YW), with small numbers of meters installed in the other locations.


The University is progressively moving away from pulse based metering, towards Modbus metering. The University is further moving away from natural gas usage, towards the use of district heating.

It is envisaged that on average, the Support Service will require 2 days per week of on-site presence.

FORMAL EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST INVITED PRIOR TO THE RUNNING OF A CLOSED TENDER: 
The University is now inviting formally structured expressions of interest in the service, before running a closed tender. RESPONSES MUST BE IN THE PRESCRIBED FORMAT. Please download the Expression of Interest letter along with all attachments including the draft contract from the University's e-tendering portal (In-Tend). RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH THIS SAME PORTAL AND NOT EMAILED DIRECT TO THE BUYER.
