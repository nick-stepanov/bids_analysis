The two-year, £8.7 million project developed by Cornish ground source heat pump infrastructure and asset company, KUL, is supported by £6.2 million of grants from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
The programme will be measured against the following outputs in accordance with ESIF-GN-1-002_ERDF_Output_Indicators_Guidance_v 9:
Additional capacity for renewable energy production (C30) - The project will add 3.5 MW of renewable heat
Estimated Green House Gasses reductions (C34) - 786 tonnes of Green House Gasses will be saved each year following completion of works delivered by this project
Number of households with improved energy consumption classification (C31) - 500 households will benefit from improved energy consumption
KUL is seeking to commission an experienced supplier to undertake a robust assessment of Heat the Streets against its target objectives, outcomes and outputs. This must be completed according to ESIF guidance.
The evaluation will consist of three phases with separate reporting requirements:
Baseline setting and assessment planning - completed by May 2022
Interim Evaluation - September 2022
Final Evaluation - April 2023
KUL is active in lobbying for strategic industry investment from the government. Learnings and evidence gained through delivery of Heat the Streets will be invaluable in this work. It is therefore a requirement that summary reports (two sides A4) are created, of key findings of the project evaluation, that will help KUL promote the benefits of networked heat pumps and move the UK towards strategic heat decarbonisation.

The company is led by a highly experienced team in the Global Med tech space.
We are looking for a talented technology partner to assist on a short-term project. The potential candidate will have experience of designing systems that handle sensitive personal medical information. We are looking for an organisation that aligns with our cultural values, has a focus on employee engagement and feedback, and can provide a record of corporate social responsibility and sustainability.
The project is one of the key deliverables of our first innovative solution, which has been designed to help improve patient outcomes after Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery. The project has two key elements
1. A secure web portal for the management of confidential medical information that will used by Healthcare Professionals and the Company and will be built to comply with all the differing regulatory requirements of the target launch markets in New Zealand, UK, Australia, and the US.
2. An IOS application which will securely manage medical/health data. The IOS application will communicate with existing Eventum's data platform. The data received will initially be sent from two locations - the iPhone health app and an Eventum sensor product via Bluetooth, which will be attached to the patient post operatively for a period of approximately 2-3 weeks.
The development of the IOS application will form a key part of Eventum Orthopaedics' future portfolio pipeline and will enable further integration of both in-house and 3rd part patient monitoring technologies.

This will support our commitment to improving the diversity of candidates applying to the Coal Authority and an ATS will give us more data on which to base our recruitment decisions, including which job boards we should use for advertising our roles and also informing any changes to our current processes.

We currently have a recruitment module within iTrent (provided by MHR) which has limited functionality and reporting which will be replaced with the selected ATS.

Key requirements are to include:
• Enable hiring managers to raise a job requisition and for the relevant approval to be given
• Anonymise all candidate CVs to remove bias during selection processes
• Enable hiring managers to complete candidate selection
• Enable the recruitment team to manage applicants from multiple sources (and identify those sources for reporting purposes)
• Integrate with iTrent to transfer successful candidates into the HR system, providing a seamless transition from applicant to employee.
• Update and inform candidates of the outcome of their application
• Contain a library of resources for recruiting managers, such as job descriptions and interview question, template emails and text messages
• Drive efficiencies in time to hire, reduce cost per hire as well as administration time - with automated HR administration processes from initial placing of job advertisements through to successful onboarding of applicants.
• Build a talent bank of applicants
• Be accessible and compliant with government accessibility requirements
• Provide management data and reporting including capturing equality and diversity data so that the Authority can see where candidates drop out of the process and identify any links to under-represented groups
• Identify anyone with a disability so that we can ensure we comply with our commitment to being a Disability Confident employer
• Promote the Coal Authority positively

The Nottingham City Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) has successfully bid for national funding as part of the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) 'Changing Futures' (CF) programme. This will be a short term programme delivered to the end of March 2024, providing specialist services, partnership delivery models and developing system change in order to achieve better outcomes for people who experience the most significant Severe Multiple Disadvantage (SMD). SMD is defined within the programme as affecting people who experience at least 3 of 5 forms of disadvantage, including: homelessness, substance misuse, mental ill-health, domestic violence, and interaction with the criminal justice system.

The objective of the CF programme is to ensure that people living in Nottingham City who experience SMD receive joined up, flexible, person-centred care from the right services, at the right time, and in the right place to meet their needs. The focus of the programme is on achieving system change to enable the development and delivery of joined up services that provide effective healthcare, support and other forms of assistance to the most excluded, marginalised and vulnerable individuals who experience SMD.

The logistics industry is going through an unprecedented and rapid transformation, paving the way for innovation and major changes. A plethora of emerging technologies are shaping the future of logistics, with changing customer requirements being a key factor in shaping the technologies used by the industry. 

These developments in both ""place"" and the digital transformation of the business environment, and ""infrastructure"" have major implications for skills and pathways into the sector. Employer engagement tells us that these skills shortages could be resolved with further training. 

Employers identified the following occupations as particular priority for upskilling within the current workforce. 

The following roles should be targeted as part of this skills package:
 
• Traffic Office - e.g., roles including Transport Planners, Managers and Coordinators, Planning Supervisors and Logistics Administrators 
• Warehousing Professionals - e.g., warehousing roles where higher-level digital skills to support digital transformation and the introduction of automation are in increased demand. 
• Roles involving Import / Export - e.g., skills and knowledge upskilling around navigating post-Brexit rules of origin Delivery should look to include, but is not limited to, modules of current L3+ apprenticeship standards or equivalent qualifications such as: 
• Transport and Warehousing Operations Supervisor • International Freight Forwarding Specialist (road freight) 
• Supply Chain Practitioner. Delivery should also look to upskill individuals working in, or to enable them to progress in occupations where there is a current gap in Apprenticeship standards, such as: 
• Fleet Managers 
• Logistics Operations Maintenance / Procurement / Warehousing Managers 

The specification is part of a longer-term plan to develop skills to ensure that businesses are better able to retain and progress staff. Increasing opportunities for upskilling and investing in staff training and development has been highlighted as a key factor in reducing staff turnover and increasing business growth. 

The overarching aim of the package is to improve skills, create pathways for progression, and prepare people for higher apprenticeships/higher levels of learning.

The project is supported by Cornwall Council, PTC and the PSB.

The core of this project is to advance beyond previous strategies and policies and create a clear vision for the town, focusing towards delivery. Whilst only concept plans these previous studies saw a common denominator of enhancing/regenerating Commercial Road, the town centre and the waterfront.  This will transform these spaces making them more inviting and pleasant for pedestrians and cyclists to use and experience.

Necessary actions are already set out in these strategies - we now need to bring these together and develop a realistic and deliverable overarching proposal that will drive our own strategy forward over the next five to ten years.
In readiness to meet these challenges we need to:

•	Procure sensitive design
•	Density of proposed development 
•	Formulate a Plan for a Sense of arrival 
•	Detailed Scheme & Initial Costs

Importantly, the revenue funding being sought through this application will enable a detailed scheme for Commercial Road and the scheme to be costed.  This approach would enable the Town Council and its Place Shaping Board to move forwards towards the creation of an outline business case to support future applications for capital funding to help deliver any scheme on the ground.  This step has been missing in previous years and why previous concept schemes have not been brought forward or delivered in part or in full.   
Building on the extraordinary natural heritage and built assets of the town, the successful team will work with the local community to address the significant challenges. They will identify a range of ambitious but fully deliverable interventions which will match our ambitions and prepare us to capture new funding opportunities as they arise and to attract appropriate inward investment.
The Contract will be with PTC, who will be responsible for overseeing the terms of the contract, issuing formal instructions/change requests and releasing payments.

Day-to-day interface on matters of service delivery/outputs will be with PTC and PSB who will advise  on the progress towards milestones, and who will provide steering and direction, where needed. The Consultants will be expected to report regularly at meetings of the PSB.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Low Pay Commission (LPC) invites tenders from researchers with ideas for new or other research in relation to the National Living Wage (NLW) (and the National Minimum Wage (NMW)). We are also keen to understand the impact of the recent unprecedented upheaval in the economy and the labour market caused by measures to control the global pandemic. This has affected some sectors, in particular many low-paying sectors, more than others. It has also disrupted many of the usual data sources upon which much of our standard analysis depends. The pandemic has, however, also led to the development of new data sources. We are therefore keen to consider tenders that can take advantage of these.

The aim is to distribute £140 million over the next five years, offering loans and other financial investments to existing and new businesses to help their long-term recovery and growth.

The WRIF will comprise of three pillars of support:

•	Business Investment Growth - Debt finance to growing medium and larger businesses with sound prospects (likely to be in the region of £90 million).

•	Local Communities and Enterprise - Smaller loans in order to support small businesses, including start-ups and social enterprises (likely to be in the region of £10 million).

•	Property and Infrastructure - Investment in commercial sites and premises to encourage businesses to invest in Warwickshire and create jobs (likely to be in the region of £40 million). 

This ITT relates to the requirement for the Property and Infrastructure Pillar. Warwickshire County Council ('the Council') is seeking an External Fund Advisor to manage the Property and Infrastructure Pillar. 

The Property & Infrastructure Pillar is intended as a flexible investment scheme that can be deployed by the Council to help developers purchase and/or for the development of new employment land or commercial space to support the growth of Warwickshire's economy. Its focus is on creating or enhancing new or existing development that will help provide the land and premises needed to drive the future growth of our economy and will therefore be linked to supporting growth in the Council's key priority sectors. 

The Fund Advisor will be responsible for the the promotion, marketing and day to day administration of the activities of the Fund.

Specifically it will demonstrate a:
•	World leading ISR capability, closely coupling 'exploit' and 'collect' throughout the ISR hierarchy, enabling collection tasking to be created dynamically and opportunistically, and AI enhanced PED from the core to the edge; and a
•	Data-led and AI-enabled Intelligence Analysis function constrained by the available data, algorithms and computational power, rather than capacity of human operators.
The overall project is addressing one of the five core capability challenges identified in the 2020 MOD Science and Technology Strategy. It supports the development of generation-after-next capabilities. This requires it to work with cutting edge and innovative suppliers in industry and academia at pace.
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Sensor Management can involve a variety of repeated, complex, high dimensional, near real time optimization calculations that are computationally very intensive. On current hardware, such calculations are not feasible for large numbers of sensors and/or significant, real-world scenario complexity. Quantum computing technology may potentially provide a means to overcome current processing limitations and deliver orders of magnitude improvement in speed for certain types of calculation, including optimization calculations.
The main focus of the proposed project is the research and development of quantum computer algorithms that support the types of battlefield Sensor Management optimization processes and scenario level data fusion processes of interest. The requirements that these processes need to meet are scenario dependent, time varying and non-linear. This means that the types and scope of application of quantum optimization and machine learning algorithms will need to be carefully considered by Suppliers.",,"SP4 0JQ",,"73200000 ","Commercial CIS Transparency",commercialcistransparency@dstl.gov.uk,"Porton Down",,SALISBURY,SP40JQ,England,,,"E30_20220609_U88_Final_Redacted_Word_pdf_metadata_Redacted.pdf ",,,18/05/2022,31/03/2023,24/04/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,239946.87,,18/05/2022,239946.87,"[FRAZER-NASH CONSULTANCY LIMITED|1 College Green Trinity Street

The impact of the pandemic has been unprecedented and widespread across our residents communities, and businesses and we are currently experiencing a challenging economic picture. Employment is flat, while falling unemployment masks a continuing decline in the size of the labour force as economic inactivity rises. While short-term unemployment is at its lowest ever, long-term unemployment is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Record vacancies signal that employers are finding it increasingly hard to fill posts. And while pay is increasing, soaring inflation means that it is declining in real terms. Taken together, this creates a toxic mix for living standards that will not resolve itself. The provision of training has a key role to play in moving people back into the labour force; improving workplace support; and helping people find good, well-paid employment and progress at work.
We want to align our skills funding to be able to deliver maximum impact so we intend to procure provision collectively - meaning we are aiming to run a single procurement opportunity for Adult Education Budget, National Skills Fund and Multiply.

The estimated length of time expected to be able to create the new offering is anticipated to be in the region of 6 to 12 months. We are therefore intending to let the contract for an initial period of 6 months with the option to extend for a further 6 month period.

To ensure service continuity, the West Midlands Combined Authority has taken the decision to award the contract to their current providers (please see list above), under Regulation 32 of the Procurement Regulations 2015 as the Services consist of a repetition of similar services entrusted to the current providers which are the same as or similar to the Services awarded under their original contracts.",,,"West Midlands","80000000 ","West Midlands Combined Authority",procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,,,,,"As stated elsewhere in this notice, The initial contract period is for 6 months, with an option to extend for a further 6 months (12 months total).

Since the last wave there have been two major economical and societal events (EU exit and Covid-19) meaning prior estimates may no longer be reliable. To be able to make accurate tax gap estimates and reduce tax losses to the HE, a re-evaluation of the scale and nature of the HE is required.

In 2018-2019 HMRC estimated £2.6bn of tax revenue was forgone due to HE activity. The HE deprives the government of funding and places an unfair burden on the compliant majority, addressing the HE is therefore key to HMRC's role of supporting compliant businesses. 

HE is a stubborn area of risk and within the context of Covid-19 underlying problems that drive the HE may have been exacerbated. Prior reports have concluded (""Tackling the tax gap"") that the pandemic may increase the risk of non-payment of taxes as more people deliberately engage with the HE.

- Experience in developing, hosting and managing website contents;
- Technical knowledge of air quality matters and be able to apply this to the design of a website's content.

Oxfordshire, like many other regions in the UK is subject to high air pollution levels. Across the County, transport emissions are the main contributor to some types of air pollution and the main reason why this region currently has 13 active Air Quality Management Areas for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and a total of 17 locations registering concentrations above the legal annual mean limit value for this pollutant.
Oxfordshire County Council and partners, have committed to the ambitious delivery of two major transport and air pollution management schemes which have been specifically designed to tackle air pollution: Oxford Zero Emission Zone and Connecting Oxford, as well as with the development of a new local transport & connectivity plan for Oxfordshire. These projects are mainly focused on the reduction of traffic levels and emissions via the reduction of the need to travel, the promotion of modal shift, and via supporting the uptake of zero and low emission transport modes. However, in order for them to be successful, they will need to be accompanied by a strong community behavioural change element, which will only be possible if the problems of poor air quality and the benefits of cleaner air can be adequately communicated to everyone.
In March 2021, the five local Authorities in Oxfordshire (Oxford City, Cherwell, West Oxfordshire, South Oxfordshire and Vale of the White Horse), together with Oxfordshire County Council were awarded a DEFRA air quality grant to develop an innovative air quality website for Oxfordshire. The website is expected to allow complete integration of all relevant air quality information from all district councils in Oxfordshire under one single platform. The website is also expected to be designed in a way that can facilitate the positive behavioural changes that are required for the successful implementation of all current and future major transport and air quality improvement schemes. It is to be used as a long term tool and platform to adequately inform, communicate and raise awareness of air pollution across the County.",,,England,"72413000 90731000 90731100 ",,procurement@oxford.gov.uk,"Oxford City Council",St.Aldates,Oxford,"OX1 1DS",England,,http://www.oxford.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Supplier/Advert/View?advertId=c86b99a9-77b6-ec11-8113-005056b64545&fromProjectDashboard=False&fromRfxSummary=False&selectWorkgroup=False&fromAdvertEvent=False&fromActivityDashboard=False ",,17/05/2022,16/05/2023,13/05/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,75000,,24/05/2022,108000,"[Ricardo-AEA Ltd|OX11 0QR|NONE||No|No]",,01/06/2022,31/05/2023,"Open ",,12:00

      Operating as a preventative and a clinical programme that focuses on behaviour change; Sandwell Smoking Cessation Support Service has a vision of enhancing health and wellbeing, improving physical and psychological quality of life and reducing the risk of disease and illness in individuals, families and communities.
      
      The new Smoking Cessation Support Service aims to be an efficiently delivered service which prioritises the needs of smokers in our population that need the service the most.  
      
      Core to service delivery is innovation and flexibility to respond to emerging developments such as advances in technologies, new research findings and system-wide developments afforded from national and local delivery ambitions.
      
      It is expected that there will be 2 main elements to service delivery:
      
      o A specialist service for cessation of smoking (covering all pharmacological and behavioural support intervention delivery management as well as brief advice/smoking cessation training to stakeholders).  This element will require delivery across the system - in particular to reflect and involve organisations/settings/groups who already encounter populations with a high prevalence of smokers.
      
      o A self-help option for cessation of smoking (directed at those already inclined to quit and with the necessary access/resource to do so).  This element will be accessed by smokers wanting to quit but not interested in the conventional approach of face-to-face or telephone support. Behavioural support will be delivered through digital means including regular motivational messages that can track progress.  Should any pharmacological needs be required alongside this, the Provider will manage such provision
      
      o Where appropriate, vape supply and support is to be ensured across both elements towards a harm reduction approach.

Leicester City Council ('the 'Authority') invited Tenders for the provision of Direct Payments Support Service. Leicester City Council (LCC) led the procurement on behalf of Leicester City Council and the Leicester, Leicestershire and
Rutland Clinical Commissioning Groups (LLR CCGs).

The Direct Payment Support Service (DPSS) will support and enable people who choose to take all or part of their Personal Budget/Personal Health Budget as a Direct Payment (DP), to use and manage their DP as easily as possible and, where they wish, independently. The requirement is that for each organisation that is awarded the Framework Agreement it must then provide all the following key functions/Services in respect of the Direct Payments Support Service:
• Initial support and set up of a DP, including advice and guidance
• Recruitment and selection support for Personal Assistants
• Payroll services and employment advice
• Managed accounts (Third Party)

The DPSS service will be available to people and families assessed by Leicester City Council as being eligible for both Adult and Children's Social Care Services living in Leicester, as well as people assessed by the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Clinical Commissioning Groups (LLRCCG) as being eligible for a personal health budget across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.

The Authority is to establish Framework Agreements, with up to three providers for the provision of Direct Payments Support Service. The Authority provides no guarantee of any work to any successful provider/s.

Up to a maximum of 3 providers are awarded the Framework Agreement. The initial term of the Framework Agreements is approximately 5 years from the Service Commencement Date 7th November 2022 to 7th November 2027 with the option to extend, subject to satisfactory performance outcomes and agreement by the Authority, for 2 further periods of up to no more than 24 months in total, to up to 4th November 2029, i.e. potentially up to 7 years from and including Service Commencement Date. The Invitation to Tender document and its appendices and all other documentation issued to Tenderers sets out the details of the Authority's requirements.

The Framework Agreements (FAs) will be Open FAs. Throughout the duration of the Framework, the Authority may review the Framework and may open the Framework at its own discretion when a service need arises. A service need includes (but is not limited to):
• a lack of capacity from current Providers and therefore there is a need to supplement the Framework List of Providers beyond the numbers operating on the Framework Agreement at that time;
• an increase in the volume of Service Users requiring Services under the Framework; and
• to replace (if required) Providers who have been removed, suspended from the Framework Agreement or did not agree to provide Services within any Extension Period.",,,England,"85000000 98000000 ","Yatish Shah",procurement-asc@leicester.gov.uk,"City Hall","115 Charles Street",Leicester,"LE1 1FZ","United Kingdom","'+44 1164542348",http://www.leicester.gov.uk,,,"Contract Award Notice",07/11/2022,04/11/2029,17/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,6300000,6300000,17/05/2022,6300000,"[ROSEKEL RESOURCING LTD|Mercury House Shipstones Business Centre, North Gate, Basford,

      This project is to be delivered between May and November 2022 alongside The Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games ('B2022' or 'the Games') build-up and delivery period.
      
      This project is part of a collaborative investment in the Games Learning Programme, and the national Legacy Plan sets out the aims:
      
      'We hope this will help young people, their families and supporting adults to: 
      o Access unique ways to participate in the Games, including through sport and culture. 
      o Raise aspirations and create an increased sense of purpose. 
      o Accelerate awareness of and improve mental wellbeing. 
      o Encourage increased physical activity and exercise, and group participation. 
      o Gain new skills and enhance experience and enjoyment of education. 
      o Gain access to Games related skills and employability opportunities'
      
      The delivery provider will provide training for the various elements of the Project Learning Programme. Please note consortium bids can be accepted if legally constituted (informal partnerships will not be accepted). Sub-contracting for elements of specialist provision is allowed if shown to be feasible in the timescales and delivers value for money. Use of existing provision is encouraged if it meets the specification for flexible person-centred provision.
      The recruitment of young people to the project must commence in May 2022 continuing through June and July. Delivery of flexible learning programmes will be over the six-month period of mid-May to mid-November so young people can progress onto further opportunities between July and November 2022, depending on the length of support provided on an individualised learning plan basis (which can include group work).
      The delivery provider must conduct an appropriate and engaging (for example co-produced) skills assessment with the young person, including soft skills, at entry point and deliver activities, qualifications, information, advice and guidance and progression support to meet individual needs.
      All of the young people engaged must be NEET. For this project NEET is defined as not in substantive employment (low hours / gig hours will not count as employment) and not attending formal education or accredited training.

All marketing and contract / Service Level Agreements (SLA) administration for Council services traded with Schools are managed by individual services on a predominantly manual basis direct with Schools.

The Council wishes to purchase a Hosted Learning Management System to administer these SLAs to provide the Council and individual services with the following identifiable benefits.

• An e-Learning platform
• A cohesive and consistent approach to the promotion of Council Services to Schools/Academies, with the flexibility to adapt service design to meet changing needs at any point during the year.
• Greater clarity for Schools as a result of the standardization of processes, with a ""one stop shop"" for all service and communication requirements.
• External customers can request service quotations and submit orders for Local Authority services from a single point
• A reduction in Council and School administration relating to the processing of SLA's and communication, offering a full audit trail.
• Reporting tools readily provide take up and income data and can identify if service teams have answered quote requests/responded to queries, giving managers a performance overview, to inform continual service improvement.

KENT001-DN602699-67543132,Contract,"Kent County Council",Awarded,2022-05-23T13:31:15+01:00,"Remote Rural Learning Service","Over the last two years and as a result of Covid, many education and employability programmes for young people have been delivered through blended or online learning approaches. This has worked for many learners, however others still have recognised and well documented barriers to participating in education and learning. These include:
• living in rural or isolated areas with poor transport links or affordability of travel meaning travelling to a learning centre is prohibitive
• Digitally excluded learners that have difficulty participating in online learning (poor/no broadband or equipment, or lacking necessary digital skills)
• lack of availability of certain courses or training in their area.

Reconnect would like to address these barriers by commissioning a mobile training and education provision that targets specific groups, areas and disadvantaged people by taking the provision to them and supporting their participation in their area.
These groups will be identified in collaboration with The Education People and other key local partners such as Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Bidders will have to have good local knowledge and relationships to enable this targeting. We would like to see innovative ideas, for example a converted vehicle or similar, to ensure that the service can reach all communities. Due to the short timescales, the bidding organisation will be required to demonstrate their ability to mobilise through a clear, realistic, and unambiguous mobilisation and delivery plan.
The focus of this provision should be offering programmes that re-engage 16-25-year-old young people with learning and training opportunities. Progression should be into further education or employment. We would like to see a range of subjects including, English, maths, employability and vocational courses linked to local employment, due to timescales, we are open to other suggestions for delivery options. We would like delivery to be in enough locations that students are able to access several sessions over the course of 4 weeks. Ideally, the bidder will work with The Education People (TEP) and other agencies, during the mobilisation period to identify a minimum of 4 locations to deliver in to allow a minimum of 1 month's delivery for each student.

Locations to be chosen in negotiation with the provider, however Suggested locations for delivery of the project include:
• Longfield
• New Ash Green
• Vigo
• Eastchurch, Warden / Leysdown
• Any rural location in West Kent
Service delivery should not be a series of taster sessions in many locations, study programmes should consist of enough sessions to gain qualifications or modules in English, maths or a vocational area linked to the local economy. Employability and other sessions may be included but should not form the majority of a learner's programme.",,,"South East","80200000 ","Sam Wright",sam.wright@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,19/05/2022,31/08/2022,01/04/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,48800,,18/05/2022,48800,"[Runway Training|8-10 South Street
