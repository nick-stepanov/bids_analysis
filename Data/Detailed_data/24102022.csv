Brief Description of Requirement

The Green Gas Support Scheme (GGSS) is a UK Government scheme designed to 
reduce the GHG emissions intensity of the UK's gas supply. Tariff payments 
incentivise the development of anaerobic digestion (AD) plants, that inject biomethane 
into the grid. Tariffs are ongoing payments paid quarterly which are based on the 
volume of biomethane injected. The GGSS is funded by a new Green Gas Levy 
(GGL) on licensed fossil fuel gas suppliers in Great Britain. 

Previously, biomethane (along with many other technologies) was supported by the 
Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (ND RHI). Registered producers of 
biomethane received quarterly tariff payments from the government over 20 years, 
based on the volume of biomethane injected into the gas grid.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,,,,10/10/2022,31/03/2026,24/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,537000,22/10/2022,479201.5,"[PSM UK Consulting LLP|Number One, Lanyon Quay, Belfast, County Antrim,  BT1 3LG|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,10/10/2022,31/03/2026,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,14:00

"Skate Park Rebuild Project",Contract,"Southwater Parish Council",Awarded,2023-08-02T10:33:07+01:00,"Southwater Skate Park Rebuild Project 2021","Southwater Parish Council is to rebuild and develop a BMX, Scooter, Blades and Skateboard Park that is to be situated in Southwater, West Sussex, on the site of the previous skate park (prior to being demolished and removed following the fire).  The site is situated on Bens Field, Stakers Lane, Southwater Country Park, Southwater, West Sussex RH13 9UN.  The site is owned by Horsham District Council and leased to Southwater Parish Council and the site's footprint is circa 590m2 in size and will need to fit all features of the project within this location. 

The scheme will restore the previous skate park that was in situ. The skate park will re-establish a much-needed leisure and sporting facility for the local community.  The construction must include a timber (or composite i.e. Skatelite) riding surface and hence is not to be a concrete structure.

It is the intention to undertake a Design and Build contract for the works.  The successful contractor will be responsible for finalising the design and delivering the construction stage of the project.  This will involve several key deliverables including the submission a technical design, liaison with the Council, ensuring a safe construction stage and warranting a smooth handover process. 

The Council will evaluate tenders on the basis of both quality (60%) and price (40%).  The Council does not undertake to accept the lowest, or any, tender submitted. The Council offers no guarantee that any tender will be recommended for acceptance or accepted and will not be held responsible for any cost incurred in the preparation of any tender.

The Contractor will fulfil the roles of Principal Designer and Principal Contractor for the purposes of the Construction (Design & Management) Regulations 2015.

For more detail, process and design specification please refer to the Invitation To Tender document and Pre-construction Information.

The tool is being developed in partnership with four local and combined authorities: Liverpool Combined Authority; Norfolk County Council; Sandwell Metropolitan Council; and Surrey County Council. 

This contract will use an existing evaluation framework and logic model to evaluate the tool - its usability, potential uptake and impact, in relation to the latest iterations of available components of the tool - in addition to a light touch evaluation of progress in the second year of the project. It will entail primary data collection and analysis of data from both primary and secondary sources. 

For more information, please refer to the accompanying RFQ.

Q: Is this a new evaluation or a continuation of the previous evaluation?
A: This is a new, distinct evaluation project that will use the evaluation framework developed in the evaluation of the first year of the Health, Wellbeing, Nature and Sustainability tool project.  

Q: Would we consider it positive that the project is undertaken by the same group as the year 1 evaluation project, or a different group?
A: We are seeking quotes from multiple organisations and will score all bidders against the same criteria as set out in the Quotation Submission section of the Request for Quotation. Only those factors set out in the Quotation Submission section will be taken into consideration in scoring bids.

Q: What amount of travel would be involved? Would the primary data collection be in person to the 4 local authorities but the rest could be online?	
A: We don't have a preference in relation to in-person data collection. The Health, Wellbeing, Nature and Sustainability tool development project has primarily been run remotely, and so project stakeholders are accustomed to participating remotely and use of e.g. Microsoft Teams for meetings. Contractors should note that all quotes will be evaluated in part on cost.

Q: Can you share the Year 1 evaluation?
A: Unfortunately we cannot share the Year 1 Evaluation report. However, the evaluation framework developed as part of the Year 1 Evaluation project is included in the Request for Quotations document.

Q: Does the contractors' experience with working with local authorities need to be England specific?

In accordance with the provisions of The Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 SI No. 2020/1319, this procurement falls to be regulated under the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015) as amended (in particular by SI 2020/1319). Prior publication of a contract notice in the Official Journal of the European Union is no longer appropriate.
It is considered that the award of the contract without prior publication of a contract notice in the UK e-notification service (in accordance with the relevant legislation) is lawful in accordance with regulation 32(2)(b)(ii) of the PCR 2015 because competition is absent for technical reasons. The MOD needs to be able to access software upgrades, updates, software development, and technical support and training for the WADER software, which can only be met by Ocean Acoustic Developments Ltd who, as the developer and owner of the source code in the software, is the only supplier with the IPR, technical skills and expertise to deliver the ongoing support requirements under the Annual Upgrade Plan.",,"PO2 8BY","South East","48218000 ",,tsz.liu100@mod.gov.uk,"4 Deck.

We would like advice from our chosen suppler as to the level of detail in which we may be able to build our systems model or map considering our timeframe and budget (whether this is at a programme level, project level or issue specific level).  The model will need to be accessible to facilitate participation within the Environment Agency and potentially with partners in the first stage to prove the concept and approach. Due to the context of our partnership approach and appetite for participative decision making we envisage a process of confidence building with the main delivery organisations. We are committed to facilitating wider participation but there are recognised challenges around information sharing in the nuclear sector due to security concerns for example. For this reason, we expect to be taking an evolutionary approach. The model will need to be suitable for adaptation to support wider civil society and citizen participation in the future.  
  
We remain flexible on our approach to this work and would work together with our chosen supplier on the best approach to undertake participative systems mapping. We are however expecting a phased approach that includes some limited participation that will form the basis for further deliberation and refinement at a later stage. We ask potential suppliers to please include further details on how they would approach participative systems mapping in their tender and how their experience with previous work similar work will add value.

      Hertsmere Borough Council is undergoing a significant refurbishment project to their Civic Centre in Borehamwood across 4 floors, and Cranbourne and Meadow Depots, involving ~500 employees to enable hybrid working and as a result, will need new furniture. The refurbishment is being managed across 9 phases.
      The supplier must be able to deliver all services within the scope described below.
      
      Scope
      o Source, store, deliver, build, and install new furniture
      o Remove and reuse, repurpose, recycle, or responsibly dispose of existing furniture in an environmentally sustainable way
      Prior to the start of each phase (e.g., 2 days before building work is due to commence), the existing furniture will need to be removed. Building work will then be undertaken for 6-8 weeks. Once building works are complete, the new furniture will need to be delivered to complete that phase (the existing furniture for the next phase will have been cleared approx. 2 days previously).
      
      Furniture removal will commence prior to building works of phase 2, the date of which is unknown. For the purposes of this tender process, 1 November 2022 should be considered the phase 2 start date. Each phase will take approximately 6 - 8 weeks. The supplier must be able to accommodate changes to the timings of the start of the project and each phase. It should be noted that there is no storage capacity onsite, so it's crucial that this is factored into the delivery plan/schedule.",,"WD6 1WA","Any region","39130000 ","Margaret Haynes (HBC)",margaret.haynes@hertsmere.gov.uk,"Elstree Way",Borehamwood,Hertfordshire,"WD6 1WA","United Kingdom","0208 207 2277",www.hertsmere.gov.uk,,,,01/11/2022,31/12/2023,15/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,0,0,21/10/2022,289673.73,"[Wagstaff Interiors Group|9 Brewhouse yard, Clerkenwell, London, United Kingdom, EC1V4JR|NONE||No|No]",,01/11/2022,31/12/2023,"Restricted ",,12:00

The external team will consist of:

·	A Programme and Project Support Partner (PPSP) via an NEC4 Professional Services Short Contract (PSSC) for each project or specific task commission. The PPSP will provide Project Management (PM), Quantity Surveyor (QS), Principal Designer (PD), Building Surveying, NEC4 Supervisor and Design services to deliver the programme of works. To be appointed following THIS tender reference 2122-28-FDR-LW.

·	A competent Principal Contractor to become our Campus Works Partner (CWP) single supplier via an NEC4 Framework Contract, with various NEC4 call-off contract options. To be appointed following tender; reference 2122-27-FDR-LW

The expectation is that through a collaborative working approach with the CWP and PPSP using a suite of NEC4 contracts, we will be best positioned to deliver the programme of minor works (projects under the value of £1m each, with a very few in the £1m to £3m band) over the next 4 years. The Estates team will work with the CWP and PPSP at a programme level to develop the projects to be delivered through this framework, adopting a flexible approach which will allow the best fit 'partner' to lead at a given RIBA stage determined by complexity of design requirements, extent of stakeholder input required in design and scale of project.
Programme & Project Support Partner
Following this tender, a framework will be established for the Programme & Project Support Partner to work in partnership with the University and Others to facilitate the delivery of all minor works and maintenance projects up to the value of £1 million including contingency plus VAT.
It will also provide flexibility to help deliver some projects between £1 million including contingency plus VAT and £3 million including contingency plus VAT when required. 
The chosen Programme & Project Support Partner will have the ability to provide core services include the following roles: Programme Lead, Project Manager, Quantity Surveyor, Principal Designer, NEC4 Supervisor, Building Surveyor and provision to subcontract construction design and engineering services to deliver the Programme of Works in partnership with the Campus Works Partner, the Client and others. This will provide greater resilience and flexibility over the potential 4 year period.

 In terms of the PPSP consultant fee we estimate this to be circa £2 - £3 million GBP over the 4 year service period.

Brief Description of Requirement

The aims of this study are to assess to what extent the most recent increases in the National Living Wage (NLW) have affected wages, employment and hours. The focus will be the most recent uprating in 2022 but should also cover the uprating's in 2020 and 2021. We are primarily interested in quantitative answers to these questions, but would also consider evidence gathered from qualitative research and interviews. Researchers should seek to take advantage of new and/or innovative methods and data sources that, as far as possible, separate out the effects of changes to minimum wages from those of the pandemic and of the UK leaving the EU.

CA18/2/1/42,Contract,"The Coal Authority",Awarded,2022-12-29T13:05:41Z,"Environmental Data Management","The Coal Authority generates large volumes of environmental data through the part of our business which manages the environmental legacy of mining across the UK. We operate over 75 mine water treatment schemes that remove contaminating metals from mine water prior to the treated water being discharged into a receiving watercourse. Schemes range from complex process engineering plants, through pumped wet wells and boreholes / mineshafts, to totally natural (passive) schemes without a power source.  The majority of treatment schemes comprise of aeration cascades, settlement ponds and reed beds. All schemes are subject to regulatory consents and licenses. 

We have an extensive monitoring network across the mine water treatment schemes monitoring scheme performance. A wider network of boreholes and sampling locations is used to monitor changes in ground water level (monitoring mine water recovery across coalfields) and water quality within mine workings and at untreated mine water discharges. The total number of monitoring locations is around 2,000 but this may rise to nearer 3,000 as new treatment schemes are built or treatment trials carried out. We are increasingly helping others with monitoring of other types of mines.

Environmental data is collected across the treatment schemes and monitoring network which includes; laboratory analysis of water and solids, onsite water quality measurements, hydrometry data including manual and logged stage and flow readings from weirs and spot flow gauging, telemetered process data (such as pump rates or electric metering), manual and logged water level and temperature measurements from boreholes or mine shafts, logged rainfall data, manual or logged gas data and solid samples of lagoon sludge. Most data types are collected as continually expanding time series. A small part of the overall data comprises geophysical surveys of boreholes and shafts.

The Coal Authority has a requirement for a single data storage system which will consolidate our environmental data sets, incorporate data processing, quality checking and editing tools (including recording of any automated, or manual data changes) and make the data more accessible for use across the business.  

We are inviting tenders for provision of an environmental data management system that will modernise the collection, quality checking, editing, storage, analysis and reporting of our environmental data.

This survey will contribute to evidence gathering in year one of the marine Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (mNCEA) inshore benthic project. This is part of a three-year Defra-funded programme, which is led by Natural England and looks to support the drive for new approaches to decision making based on the Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) approach. This means using comprehensive evidence of the benefits provided through marine benthic habitats and species (food, carbon storage, well-being etc.) to increase confidence, and to reduce time and costs associated with making complex environmental decisions concerning the marine environment. The end product will be a suite of natural capital tools which will be used in decision making.

This survey will gather evidence on the quantity and quality of intertidal ecosystem assets. The work is packaged in two Lots; Lot 1 for the Solway Firth SAC, and Lot 2 for Morecambe Bay SAC. Contractors are invited to apply for either one or both of these lots. The aims, objectives, methods and data output requirements are the same for both Lots.

The evidence gathered in this survey will improve the coverage, scale and quality of ecological evidence (specifically intertidal benthic habitats). Detailed survey and analyses will enable us to understand the distribution and scale provisioning services of the sediments to marine birds, and humans (shellfish). Evidence gathering in year 1 of the mNCEA programme will feed into Natural England's natural capital understanding of not only biodiversity but other ecosystem services.

CW83149,Contract,"H M Revenue & Customs",Awarded,2022-11-16T10:40:53Z,"Impact of a flexible model of calculation for the IYC pilot and future timely payment","This is a KAI Social Research contract let through the Research and Insights DPS to tender mixed-methods research to explore ITSA customers' views on the impact of a flexible model of calculation for the in-year calculation pilot, and future timely payment.

From April, a three year in-year calculation pilot (IYC) commences; this will build insight and enable the testing of policy/system design choices for future timely payment (TP) (bringing the calculation and payment of tax closer to the point where income or profit arises for taxpayers, paying tax based in their current year position). Customers, through the TP CfE, challenged a 'one size fits all' model of TP. This research will help determine policy/design options of a flexible model which can be tested through the IYC pilot, to help build a calculation system which supports customers whilst realising wider government benefits.

As part of the Tax Administration Strategy (TAS), we published a CfE on TP, exploring perceptions around the benefits/challenges of TP. Many respondents highlighted the need for a flexible model of TP, which reflected the diversity of the SA population.
This view was echoed by internal research which found that customers would broadly support and engage with TP if there was flexibility, control, and structure. This research proposes a deeper dive into what these elements could look like practically for customers, and how this may differ across populations/customer groups/business models.

The IYC pilot runs for 3 years, and through it we will be able to test policy choices and mitigation. The first year of the pilot involves detailed investigation, internal and external co-design activity to establish optimal design, delivery, evaluation, and evidence requirements. The timing of this research will compliment this phase, allowing maximum input into design

This research will first collect quantitative data on ITSA customers' experience of gathering and submitting information to facilitate tax calculation, paying tax and appetite for IYC and TP, including anticipated impacts, benefits and challenges. A second, qualitative stage will explore in-depth, the potential financial and other effects of IYC and TP on ITSA taxpayers (including vulnerable customers), exploring issues around structure, control and flexibility. Both elements will be instrumental in identifying considerations to help shape IYC system/policy design (to test through the three-year IYC pilot) and inform policy options and costings for TP

Both stages of the research will take cognisance of findings from relevant work (e.g. undertaken by HMRC Policy Lab examining issues around cashflow and the implications for more frequent tax payments; two soon-to-be-published research reports examining the tax challenges faced by self-employed taxpayers and MTD for ITSA customers).",,,"United Kingdom","73000000 ","Fintan Bradley",fintan.bradley@hmrc.gov.uk,"Trinity Bridge House, 2 Dearmans Place",,Salford,"M3 5BS",England,,,"Contract Zip.zip ",,,20/10/2022,19/10/2023,19/10/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,180000,,19/10/2022,180000,"[IFF Research Ltd|St Magnus House, 3 Lower Thames Street, London, EC3R 6HD|COMPANIES_HOUSE|849983|No|No]",,20/10/2022,19/10/2023,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,17:00

Through the initial pilot year, the successful delivery partner, along with an external evaluator, will be required to combine these approaches into a 'mentoring' model. Mentors will work closely with individual pupils and their families supporting them and working to address any individual barriers to attendance they might face in conjunction with their school, local authority, and other relevant services.
The frequency and duration of the support provided will differ between each pupil depending on their specific circumstances. The successful delivery partner will need to test and refine the approach during this period before expanding to the full trial in years two and three with a more defined intervention and evaluation. After the first year, we will look to build evidence about the efficacy of the approach in different circumstances.
By the end of the three-year programme, we would expect to have achieved the following outcomes:
- Have improved overall attendance levels and engagement with education for all pupils who are participating.
- Developed our understanding of effective practice and different delivery models when delivering 1-1 support to pupils who are persistent or severely absent.
- Improved the evidence base about how best to support individual pupils to regularly attend school through a rigorous evaluation of this intervention, that helps us understand the value for money, and helps schools, trusts and LAs make evidence informed decisions.
- Tested this intervention on a cohort of pupils with severe and persistent absence to understand what works for the children with the greatest level of need.",,,"Any region","98000000 ",,sendbaea.commercial@education.gov.uk,"Bishopsgate House",,Darlington,"DL1 5QE",England,,,"Mid-Tier_-_Contract_Award_Form_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Core_Terms_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_10_-_Service_Levels_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_13_-_Contract_Management_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_16_-_Security_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_19_-_Cyber_Essentials_Scheme_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_1_-_Definitions_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_20_-_Processing_Data_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_21_-_Variation_Form_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_22__-_Insurance_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_25_-_Rectification_Plan_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_26_-_Sustainability_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_2_-_Specification_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_30_-_Exit_Management_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_36_-_IPR_-_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_3_-_Charges_v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_4_-_Tender__v1.1.pdf Mid-Tier_-_Schedule_5_-_Commercially_Sensitive_Information_v1.1.pdf ",,,01/10/2022,30/09/2025,14/07/2022,YES,tender_302331/1077363,Yes,Yes,No,Services,2320000,,20/10/2022,2320000,"[Barnardo&apos;s|Tanners Lane, Ilford, Essex, IG61QG|COMPANIES_HOUSE|1041497|No|Yes]",,01/10/2022,30/09/2025,"OpenOJEU ",,17:00

Intelligence tells us that there are still skills gaps across GM we could tackle with this opportunity, and we know that providers on our FPS have a lot to contribute to this using their own work with employers and knowledge of skills gaps in GM.

Therefore, we created a £6m innovation pot to allow providers to put forward innovative ideas that they believe can help to tackle some of the skills gaps which have not already been addressed, meet the ESF requirements and wider programme aims, and be delivered within the timescale available.

The specification is part of a longer-term plan to develop skills to ensure that businesses are better able to retain and progress staff. Increasing opportunities for upskilling and investing in staff training and development has been highlighted as a key factor in reducing staff turnover and increasing business growth. The overarching aim of the package is to improve skills, create pathways for progression, and prepare people for higher apprenticeships/higher levels of learning.

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the CCS RM6126 DPS

Brief Description of Requirement:
The project is intended to obtain quantitative insights into the scale of possible system benefits from optimally efficient locational signals, to inform market design policy decisions under the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA). At a high level , the results will also have relevant to policy strategy for future Contracts for Difference auction rounds.
This research project is not intended to inform a specific policy recommendation on how best to send locational signals; we anticipate that the concept of 'optimal' locational signals would be represented in the model through siting and dispatch decisions (for generation and flexibility assets) being made endogenously to minimise system costs, within a set of exogenous constraints. Results from this project would complement other evidence gathering and policy development on specific mechanisms for delivering signals within the wider packages of reforms being considered by REMA.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"UK SBS, Polaris House, North Star Avenue",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,www.uksbs.co.uk,"PS22252 - Low Carbon Assets  Systems Benefits from Efficient Locational Signals (RAF039-2223) -Fully Signed_Redacted.pdf ",,,19/10/2022,13/02/2023,21/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,99979.1,,18/10/2022,99979.1,"[GRANT THORNTON UK LLP|30 Finsbury Square, London, England, EC2A 1AG|COMPANIES_HOUSE|OC307742|No|No]",,19/10/2022,13/02/2023,"CompetitiveQuotationNonOJEU ",,14:00

The Southend Essex and Thurrock (SET) Executive Collaborative Commissioning Forum is looking to improve digital and remote access to mental health support and counselling services for children and young people (CYP), enhancing the mental health of young people and their families across the seven Essex CCG localities, Essex County Council, Southend Borough Council and Thurrock Council.

Locally, commissioners recognise that CAMHS are struggling to meet growing demand from young people for mental health services and are exploring how digital technologies can help support young people in a less resource intensive way-especially where young people do not need the level of specialist community intervention that CAMHS provides
The Provider will ensure they comply with locality policies and procedures, with particular regard to encouraging young people to be as involved as possible in planning and care decisions and to ensure the needs and circumstances of individuals are made visible in their policy and practice. The Provider will ensure they build partnering relationships / pathway working with statutory health and social care services

The Council seeks a Service Provider to facilitate bulk purchase of EN590 white road grade diesel, and have the fuel purchased placed into the bunker network operated by UK Fuels and Key Fuels.

The Customers' staff will then draw the fuel it has purchased from a number of forecourts located throughout the UK, by use of a fuel card issued by one of the UK fuel bunker card providers such as UK Fuels or Key Fuels.

The contract has been awarded using the Direct Award procedure under ESPO Framework 301_22 for liquid fuels.

The Framework pricing is based on a weekly PLATTS commodity price plus supplier margin price. Therefore, the value of the contract is permitted to either increase or decrease depending on the market price for diesel. 

Due to current volatility in the fuel markets, the Council cannot provide an accurate forecast of what it might pay over the course of the contract, however, the supplier's margin is fixed for the duration of this agreement. Only the tracked indexed commodity (PLATTS) cost element of the price is permitted to fluctuate under this contract.

      In December of last year, the Department of Health and Social Care published the White Paper 'People at the Heart of Care' which outlines the 10-year vision for the reform of the sector. The White Paper recognised that when technology is embedded seamlessly into care and support services, it can help people to live happy, fulfilled lives in their homes and communities. To support this goal, and the government's wider ambitions for reform, the White Paper committed to invest in digitising the social care sector.
      
      In order to meet this commitment, Birmingham City Council (the Council) is looking to partner with an organisation that will lead on ensuring that the Digital Transformation Programme objectives are met:
      
      ? 80% of adult social care CQC registered providers will have adopted a digital social care record by March 2024 (target is 60% by March 2023)
      ? By March 2024 sensor-based falls prevention and detection technologies, such as acoustic monitoring, will be in use in care homes for the residents they have identified as most at risk of falls, reaching at least 20% of residents nationally (target is 10% by March 2023)
      ? Testing other types of care technology, driven by the benefits case and local need
      
      There is an requirement to produce a robust communications and engagement plan to ensure that all Care Providers across Birmingham are informed of the programme, the key requirements to implement Digital Social Care Recording, Sensor-Based Falls Technology and other Technology and the impact that these systems can have both from a citizen perspective and from the Care Provider service.
      
      This contract will be from October 2022 to October 2025.
