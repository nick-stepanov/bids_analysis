Meadow High School is the only Council maintained Secondary Special school, as well as the only Secondary Special for pupils with Moderate Learning Difficulties and Autism (MLD and ASD). It has continuously expanded over past few years, with the pupil number currently on roll being circa 250. The school partially relies on four old double modular units, they are unsuitable for use by pupils with limited mobility and are at the end of their serviceable life so need to be replaced over the next few years. This would reduce the total capacity at the school by 82, however the Council need more places in the school to meet rising demand and reduce the use of independent placements, which are far more expensive per pupil.
Agreement was received to progress with the expansion of Meadow High School via the following works:
a) Refurbishment of the Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) constructed boarding block at Harefield Academy for use by Meadow High School and relocating up to 90 pupils from the existing Meadow High School site to this refurbished block.

Existing site and building

The Harefield Academy boarding block was constructed 10 years ago but is no longer being used. The boarding block is 3 storeys with an open central atrium across all 3 storeys. The bedrooms and kitchens are on the first and second floor around the edge of the building with corridor leading to these bedrooms overlooking the atrium. As the block is made up of a series of small rooms there is a requirement to reconfigure the internal area to provide spaces of suitably large size for use by a school.",,"UB8 1UW","Any region","45000000 ",,mbreen@hillingdon.gov.uk,"Civic Centre,",,Uxbridge,"UB8 1UW",England,,,,,,25/07/2022,02/09/2022,17/06/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Works,520099.23,,10/08/2022,520099.23,"[McLaughlin & Harvey Ltd|15 Trench Road, Mallusk.

The pipes were installed through directional drilling and emerge from under the sea bed at the discharge point. Each pipe comes to a T piece with duck bill diffuser elements fitted to each end of the T section. 

The base of the discharge arrangement was not sufficiently supported and this has allowed the pipework to rotate impacting discharge flows.

This needs to be repaired and returned to the correct position with improvements to the support of the diffusers from a pre cast concrete base. The diffusers also had a protective structure that has been dislodged and this needs to be replaced by a new protective sleeve and cap. The protective sleeve can either be a pre-cast concrete pipe or an HDPE pipe section which will be capped by a pre-cast concrete or GRP lid. 

The replacement duckbills will have to be fitted after the sleeve is placed. Alternatively, arch shaped cut-outs could be implemented, to fit over the duckbills. The ""duckbill"" check valves will protrude slightly through holes/ windows prepared for purpose and will discharge normally. 

Construction

Due to operational requirements shut down of the pipelines must be well planned and durations kept to a minimum. Based on our feasibility studies the shutdowns are estimated to be no longer than 3 hours per pipeline. All the rehabilitation operations that require no flow through the pipe must be programmed to take place at the same time so that only one shut-down period is required.
The following tasks will need to be completed under shutdown:
•	Disconnection of the flange adapter and replace. 
•	Align the diffuser to vertical and temporarily secure. 
•	Remove the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves. 
•	Drop the protection sleeve into position. 
•	Replacing the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves

Divers to conduct the following site preparation activities. 
•	Clearing loose rubble around the flange adapter and concrete base footprint. 
•	Rock drilling may be required to level concrete base footprint. 


After Pipeline Shutdown 
•	Replace/ rehabilitate and install: 
•	Blank flange o Sacrificial break away spool piece (optional) 
•	Flange Adapter - and right the diffuser to vertical alignment. 
•	Remove the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves. 
•	Place and secure precast concrete base 
•	Drop the protection sleeve into position. 
•	Replace the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves 

After Resume Pipeline Flow 
•	Grout fill around flange adapter. 
•	Place and secure protective sleeve cap.
•	A marker buoy with independent anchorage is also to be installed.

SCC-ICU-0043,Contract,"SOUTHAMPTON CITY COUNCIL",Awarded,2022-11-17T08:22:23Z,"Discharge to Assess Care Act Assessments","Southampton City Council invites potential suppliers to submit tenders for the provision of 150 Discharge to Assess Care Act Assessments over a 4-month period.  Patients discharging from hospital requiring ongoing care should receive any assessment of need in a community setting, either their own home or an alternative environment (e.g.nursing or care home). 

The expectation that ongoing assessment of need is undertaken in the community is termed ""Discharge to Assess"" (D2A) and is the default hospital discharge approach.

Each ""care act assessment"" will be in respect to new packages of care/placements and may include the undertaking of mental capacity assessments as required. The overarching aim of the service will be to:  

•            Provide Care Act assessment and support planning services to a predefined number of service users as set out in chapter 6 of the Care Act Guidance  
•            Provide Care Act reviews of support plans to a predefined number of service users as set out in chapter 13 of the Care Act Guidance 

Individuals being assessed will be adults aged over 18 discharging from hospital who require an assessment of need.
The provider will carry out person-centred, strengths-based assessments and reviews, along with associated support planning, in accordance with Care Act 2014 principles in line with Southampton City Council policies, which will be shared with the provider during service mobilisation.

The financial envelope for this procurement is up to £80,000 for the 4-month period covered by the initial contract term. 
In the event that additional Care Act Assessments are required, and if future funding is available, the Council reserves the option to extend the contract term by up to two extension periods - each of two months - which would extend the financial envelope by up to a further £80,000 in total, (i.e., up to £40,000 for each period of extension) - such that the maximum value of the contract is potentially £160,000. Please see Document 3 Service Specification for more service related information. Due to the urgency for the service provision, this procurement will follow an accelerated Open type procedure and will be conducted in compliance with The Public Contracts Regulations 74-77, 2015, under the Light Touch Regime. It is essential that the service provider is able to mobilise service delivery to enable a contract start date of 18th July 2022.",,"SO14 7LY","Any region","85000000 85300000 85310000 ",,tendermanagement@southampton.gov.uk,"Civic Centre, Civic Centre, Southampton",", ,",Southampton,"SO14 7LY","UNITED KINGDOM","023 8083 3000",,,"https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/Account/Login?cid=sout019 ",,18/07/2022,18/11/2022,22/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,80000,160000,11/08/2022,152772,"[FIVE SOCIAL CARE LIMITED|9 Alnwick Way

Proposals should be brief and cover the following
- Previous experience and skills in overseas due diligence

Proposals are sought that would provide the project with a baseline of current technology and regular horizon scanning and selected technology watch outputs identifying new ideas, techniques and technology for further investigation within the project. Dstl defines Horizon Scanning as: 

Processes and techniques for the systematic identification, at an early stage, of important but unfamiliar developments, to create new opportunities and mitigate risks arising through surprise. Dstl defines Technology Watch as: 

Processes and techniques for monitoring the evolution of technologies and technology areas which are known to be of interest. These include following the maturation cycle of emerging technologies and identifying new applications for existing technologies. 

Therefore, in horizon scanning, new technical areas of interest are realised only after information has been retrieved, whereas in technology watch, technical areas of interest are specified before information is retrieved. Ideas can be at any maturity level from initial idea to concept but should be innovative and present a fresh 
approach for military deception. 

The scope of the MDBD project covers all aspects of 'technical' deception. Whilst 'technical' deception is not an official term, it is taken to refer to the use of technology options as part of deception actions. 

An initial baselining activity would provide a snapshot of; 
1/Technologies with the potential for use in deception activity 
2/The current level of development of technologies and likelihood of further development 
3/For those technologies that are commercially available 
4/The availability (eg. widespread or single source) 
a/Current usage/market 
b/Indicative costs 
c/Likelihood of further development 

It is suggested that following the baselining activity, horizon scanning output is delivered quarterly over a period of three years. Selected topics for technology watch would be agreed following discussions with Dstl and the supplier and updates on those topics would be provided at least annually. 

The expectation is that this task will; 
Maintain a watching brief for new technologies and concepts that may have potential for use in UK military deception activities.

This service will be for the residents of the London Borough of Bexley and the Royal London Borough of Greenwich who have had Covid for more than 12 weeks and who are still not recovered.

It is currently estimated that for patients who have had COVID between 5 to 2.5% will go on to develop post COVID /long COVID syndrome dependent on the sources of research.
For some of these patients this will be linked to discharge from an inpatient stay in the acute services following a certain level of severity to COVID.  For other patients the prolonged conditions may occur after they have felt recovered from the symptoms of COVID.  

The overall aim of the service is to support patients who continue to have post-COVID symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue and muscle pain to better understand and manage these symptoms and enhance a functional recovery.

The Small Medium Size (SME) Provider will need to demonstrate a proven track record of delivering a post covid rehabilitation in South East London, for supporting  patients with the following:

•	To understand why they still feel symptoms  
•	To be able to recognise and optimise their pattern/rate of breathing.
•	To manage activity levels and stabilise their fatigue.
•	To recognise if they need further help with psychological support
•	To support the patient through rehabilitation to move on a journey closer to fitness levels pre-COVID

The service must be delivered as either a virtual or face to face class (or a combination), for 1.5 hours per week, over an 8 week period.  Where classes are delivered face to face, this must be in a convenient, accessible location within the London Borough of Bexley, with parking available and good transport links.

The key outcomes to be demonstrated improvements in the following:
•	Breathing pattern disorder
•	Hyperventilation 
•	Fatigue severity scale
•	Anxiety 
•	Depression

Proposed total duration of contract:

1 year + optional 1 year

Proposed contract value:

It changed the ways we have worked before and created various opportunities. Public Health Division initially continued with business-as-usual (BAU) work and members of staff rotated in the Covid cell where local guidance, based on National's, would be generated. Shortly after, BAU took a back seat and the division broke out into various cells to address Covid - (1) Health Protection , (2) Wellbeing, (3) Communications and Engagement, (4) Data and Governance and (5) Procurement. Individuals from across the council were redeployed to support Public Health Covid Response. 
      
      However, due to the need for BAU work to continue, the model was slightly modified and additional capacity was recruited. The Test and Trace team was created which consisted of 5 sub-teams; (1) Business Strategy, (2) Communications and Engagement, (3) Data and Governance, (4) Health Protection Response, (5) Contact Tracing. BAU members of staff went back to their substantive posts and those who wanted to stay applied into secondment opportunities. The rota system using BAU resources, initially introduced at the beginning of the pandemic, continued to support the Health Protection Response Team as and when Covid peaks stretched the team's capacity. There has been great staff turnover and additional posts created in response to the fluid environment that the pandemic brought about. 
      
      The Council will provide appropriate and proportionate expert public health advice, support and signpost to appropriate information. The Council will work with the provider to enable the contract delivery as much as possible. Example of support are as below. This list is not exhaustive:
      - Guidance throughout to ensure the report maps the service specification
      - Support with identifying participants
      The project should include synthesized data collected from the below sample to cover aspects of Covid-19 Response and its evaluation as set out in Service Specifications e.g.
      
      o What worked well and did not work well during Covid-19 
      o What could have been tried or done differently
      o Elements of pre-pandemic ways and methods of working that the Division may benefit from reverting to 
      o Elements of pandemic ways of working that the Division may benefit from taking forward 
      o Reflections and improvements on Communications, Collaboration and Partnership-working during the pandemic 
      o Skills and Knowledge learnt and developed during Response to Covid-19 and key training needed for officers to prepare for future pandemic / emergency situations.

The NLHPP is a programme of works carried out for the Authority at its 'EcoPark' site, in Edmonton, London N18 AG. The minor works involve the construction and commissioning of enhancements to the civil infrastructure in and around the EcoPark, and may include but not be limited to: 
      
      (i) intrusive site investigations to verify the location of services and underground obstructions;
      (ii) alterations and enhancements to roads and pedestrian accesses to enable the EcoPark to function whilst the new NLHPP facilities are   constructed and brought into service. These may span watercourses, as well as working with the relevant highway authority for adopted highways;
      (iii) alterations and enhancements to EcoPark security infrastructure to enable NLHPP construction areas to operate within the EcoPark's overall security system;
      (iv) temporary and permanent alterations to the EcoPark water and drainage systems to enable the construction of NLHPP facilities;
      (v) diversion of utilities to enable NLHPP delivery; 
      (vi)  landscaping reinstatement of soft verges and footpaths around the EcoPark;
      (vii) supply and install temporary buildings; and
      (viii) removal of any temporary structure erected during the NLHPP works.
      
      The works are required to enable the efficient and effective delivery of the NLHPP for the development of a replacement energy recovery facility and associated works at the EcoPark pursuant to a development consent order granted to the Authority on 24.2.2017. It is anticipated that design of any works under the framework will typically be carried out by the Authority's technical advisor to enable the contractor to carry out construction. The contractor may be required to design certain elements of detailed design.

The Framework arrangement will consist of an initial term of 2 years, plus 2 options to extend up to a further 12 months each.

As part of a wide range of projects across Council properties, North Tyneside Council has a programme of works which may require structural engineering design consultancy. It is anticipated that need will arise to appoint external structural engineering design consultants to work alongside the in-house design team on such projects.

This tender invites you to submit competitive services and fee quotations for provision of Structural Engineering Design Services in respect of the included 'Example Projects' of hypothetical typical works which will allow the Council to assess competitive bids and establish a framework of consultancies. The companies in this framework can then be invited to provide 'mini competition' quotations for specific projects with details and schedules of services per project identified.

Following this tender exercise, it is envisaged that 3 Contractors will be appointed to the Framework.

Questions relating to gang membership and knife carrying are asked of 10-29-year-olds within the self-completion section of the adult and child questionnaire. There are also a small number of questions in the victimisation module, which ask all respondents who report being a victim of crime about whether they think the incident was gang related and whether the person who did it was a member of a gang. 

Following a consultation with key stakeholders and users of our data, we have identified issues with the existing survey questions on gangs and knife carrying. This includes:
•	The nature of gangs and policy priorities have evolved since the questions were first developed, such as the expansion of County Lines.
•	The definition of gangs is too broad and doesn't differentiate between gangs where crime is and isn't involved
•	The need for more granular questions to understand the nature of gang involvement 
Therefore, re-development of the existing survey questions on gangs and knife carrying is required to address these issues and ensure the questions reflect policy priorities.",,"NP10 8XG",,"73110000 ","Matt Andrew",pu.projects@ons.gov.uk,"Government Buildings,Cardiff Road",,NEWPORT,NP108XG,Wales,"'+44 1633 580113",,,,,17/08/2022,31/01/2023,08/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,52685,,08/08/2022,52685,"[CREST ADVISORY (UK) LIMITED|2, BATH PLACE

The company will undertake relevant, global and time saving due diligence, by providing comprehensive donor due diligence reports on individuals, companies, trusts and foundations who are at the stage of cultivation where they could be solicited for a philanthropic donation by NUA.
This is to ensure that any donation to Newcastle University would not cause any legal or reputational issues. The checks will help protect Newcastle University from fraud and reputational damage and guarantee a process that protects and boosts Newcastle University's reputation for the long term.
The outsourcing of due diligence checks will ensure that all Newcastle University stakeholders have access to, and understand, all available information relevant to safeguarding Newcastle University's reputation, including benefits and potential liabilities, to make fully informed decisions about accepting a philanthropic donation.
Over a 12-month period, the company will help support three major stages of the due diligence process:
1.	Research
The company will provide a service that can mine all online data sources and deliver the specific insights needed, gathering data, and collecting information quickly and efficiently.

2.	Analysis
The company will help decide what information is relevant and draw detailed, actionable insights from it, providing support to disambiguate data, helping NUA to save time and resources.

3.	Delivery

Lasting 42 days, the voyage will work with these two UK Overseas Territories to collect important scientific data and ultimately further inform ongoing work to protect these unique marine environments. 

The RRS Discovery expedition (DY159) is a multi-disciplinary marine research expedition that will collect vital data from two large Atlantic marine protected areas (MPAs), around the islands of Ascension and St Helena. 

Objectives:
1. Capture high quality photographs, video and live stream content (where  possible) throughout the duration of the DY159 survey for use within pro-active Blue Belt Programme communications (e.g. social media content).
2. Use the content collected during the survey to create a bank of quality photographic and video content that effectively visualizes the various activities undertaken during the survey and with the UKOTs, ensuring usability for Blue Belt communications assets. 
3. Work with the Blue Belt communications team (a member of which will be on board) to ensure that the content captured links with and feeds into the wider communications, outreach, education, and science objectives of the expedition. 
4. Please note a dedicated communications plan will be developed by the Blue Belt communications team which supports and informs this, and planning meetings can take place prior to DY159's departure to plan content and scope ideas..
5. Use the content collected to create a short documentary style film of around five minutes which tells the story of the survey's duration, providing insight into life on board, highlights key objectives and how it achieved them, as well as ultimately linking its purpose to the work of the Blue Belt Programme.",,,"Any region","71351911 92110000 ",,procure@cefas.co.uk,"Cefas Lowestoft Laboratory",,Lowestoft,"NR33 0HT",England,,,"Signed_CEFAS22-56_Short_Form_Contract_Redacted.pdf ",,,12/08/2022,31/01/2023,12/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,21700,,12/08/2022,21700,"[Swimming Head Productions|3 Dunstanville Terrace, Falmouth, Cornwall, TR11 2SW, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,12/08/2022,31/01/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

Our indirect stakeholders include retail shareholders, suppliers, employees, customers, communities, pensioners and savers, and financial institutions, all of whom have an interest in the health of companies and other organisations within our existing and future regulatory scope and in the success of the UK corporate sector as a whole.

tender_311378/1095958,Contract,"Department for Work and Pensions",Awarded,2022-08-08T17:24:14+01:00,"Transaction Risking DataOps","The Covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented surge in demand on the welfare system, resulting in a hugely increased operational workload across DWP. To process benefit claims and pay customers their entitlement, there was an easement of controls that led to increasing levels of fraud and error. This is now at unprecedented levels, with £8.4bn overpaid in 2020/21.
The Integrated Risk and Intelligence Service (IRIS) provides a service to support identification of singleton and organised fraud and error. IRIS has been challenged to be more real time and adapt to changing fraud risks. To deliver a better service, IRIS needs to:
-	Accelerate fraud and error prevention at the point of application and in advance of payment to reduce benefit overpayment and lower the debt burden on claimants.
-	Enhance DWP's fraud and error decision making through consolidating sources of risk into a single view of risk to inform routing and intervention types.
-	Better target operational resource to focus on the highest risk cases associated with the largest financial impact, enabling resourcing to risk.
This is being achieved through investment in a cloud-based analytics platform where new fraud and error identification capabilities will be developed including machine learning, and a risk engine that will act as a funnel for all the different risk types and provide a triage function.

The project will deliver a core data integration capability that:

-	Implements event-driven ETL pipelines and self-serve tooling to provide re-useable and extensible data workflows by integrating data from currently available systems and lines of business as well as securely ingesting and integrating 3rd party data (e.g. through automated data pipelines or by setting up API's). Some of these systems may not yet have the ability to interface with Transaction Risking and the infrastructure to support integration may not yet be in place. The Department is driving towards real-time analytics and so data should be incorporated in near real time where that is possible.

-	Implements a data treatment service with obfuscation of personal data and security controls in place to ensure individuals and tools have appropriate data visibility, while retaining an appropriate level of detail so that the data can be linked and meaningful analysis of the data is still possible. 

-	Implements a data matching capability to resolve common entities across all data sets to enable claimants (and other entities of interest) to be tracked across multiple data sources. This will include creating the ability to link personal data securely in a cloud environment. 

-	Conforms to a consistent data model so data sets from multiple source systems are interoperable, making analytics development and insight generation more efficient.

-	Is extensible to enable further integration of other event data sources in future e.g. other lines of business or data sources.",,"SW1H 9NA",London,"72000000 ",,mark.cranshaw@dwp.gov.uk,"DWP, Peel Park, Brunel Way",,Blackpool,"FY4 5ES",England,,,"DataOps - G-Cloud-12-Call-Off-Contract_final_redacted.pdf ",,,10/08/2022,31/03/2023,07/08/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1624184,,08/08/2022,1624184,"[Scott Logic|6th Floor, The Lumen St James Boulevard Newcastle Helix Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 5BZ|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,10/08/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,23:59
