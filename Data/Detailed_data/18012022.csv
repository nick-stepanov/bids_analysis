Purpose:
•	To improve access onto the Marriotts way from Cawston
•	To repair or replace the existing steps onto the Marriotts way
•	To repair the fenceline under the Cawston bridge
•	To install a Granite footpath from the Cawston bridge to Chapel Street
Notes:
•	A new permanent handrail needs installing to improve access. This needs to be installed independently of the existing steps structure, to allow replacement of the latter.
•	Footfall-driven erosion above the steps is ongoing and the usage has necessitated a repair.
•	Anecdotally speaking, the site is busy year round. 
Actions:
•	Funding to be allocated to carry out scheme of improvements.
•	Agreement to be reached between contractor and Norfolk Trails Officers to approve program of works.

Some notable inward investment has been achieved, resulting in a new leisure centre, and two significant housing areas off Preston Manor Road and on the De Burgh site, off Chetwode Rd.  In addition, other elements include initiating and supporting new evening bus services, bus stop improvements and the creation of on-street parking lay-bys.  These transport improvements have been carried out with the support and cooperation of the Surrey County Council (SCC), the Local Highway Authority.

Despite numerous new parking bays being constructed across the Preston area there is still on-street parking issues in the area north of Chetwode Rd, specifically in Long Walk and Coxdean.  The Borough would like to appoint consultants in transport planning and highway design, to prepare designs for new parking bays, partly on the verge and with widen footways. Approximately 250m length of verge parking is involved.   The budget for these projects comes from CIL funding arising from the development of the De Burgh site now being developed by London Square Developments.

New Parking Locations
Long Walk and Coxdean are located in the north of the Preston area.  These roads are a popular access route used by local residents living within the Preston area off Chetwode Rd and Marbles Way for accessing the A240 to the north east or Epsom to the north west, rather than using Merland Rise, the principal district distributor through the area.  These residential roads are heavily parked with most drivers parking two road wheels on the footway, restricting movement for pedestrians.    The solution adopted in Chetwode Rd and Merland Rise involves introducing a battered kerb and paved verge to permit vehicles to park with two wheels on the strengthened verge.  A similar solution is envisaged.

In Long Walk and Coxdean there is no verge.  Offering verge parking will require widening the footways and aquiring land from Raven Housing Trust who own and manage most of the land within the Preston estate.  Pedestrian footfall is high in these streets with the journey to school the most common trip.   Initial preliminary agreement has been reached with Raven, and, as a result, they will freely dedicate what open space/verge is necessary to widen footways that will enable the new parking bays to be created.   The client lead will be responsible for progressing the land dedication process with Raven and SCC.  The consultant will support by preparing land dedication and licence plans under guidance form the client lead

Solutions for Coxdean may also require some treatment of levels, including minor earthworks and structures, particularly to increase the size of the existing layby midway along this street.",,,"South East","71220000 ","Sourcing Solutions Team",OrbisSourcingSolutions@eastsussex.gov.uk,"Town Hall,Castlefield Road",,REIGATE,RH20SH,England,,,,,,01/02/2022,31/01/2024,20/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,34964,,18/01/2022,34964,"[GUTTERIDGE HASKINS & DAVEY LIMITED|Level 1, Building 49, Thornton Science Park,Pool Lane

Newcastle University) will be a unique national facility to fulfil a strategically and critically
important research infrastructure gap in the region. The facility aligns with the institutional
strategy that includes the establishment of Centres for Research Excellence in Energy, Data
and Cancer and the establishment of NU Academic Track Fellowships, several of whom will
benefit from this facility. Transient absorption spectroscopy is a key tool that enables
scientists to probe the identity, formation and fate of short-lived, energetic species formed
on excitation with light (e.g. from a laser). It permits ultrafast optical and near infrared
spectroscopy on a range of molecular, biological and functional material systems to provide
critical mechanistic information on light-induced reaction pathways. This includes tracking
the dynamics of key excited state and charge-transfer intermediates that lie at the heart of a
vast amount of chemistry, from solar energy conversion to enzyme reactions. This national
facility will support several multidisciplinary fields with substantial potential for societal and
economic impact, including
(1) Energy (e.g. emerging photovoltaic technology, solar-driven H2 evolution and CO2
conversion to fuels and feedstocks) research which is supported by joint, collaborative
centres, the EPSRC/ISCF North East Centre for Energy Materials (NECEM) and the EPSRC
Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy at North east Universities (ReNU).
Page 4 to 8
(2) Photonic materials and metamaterials (e.g. Organic LEDs, energy transfer in solid state
materials, 2D and 3D materials in LEDs and waveguides).
(3) Chemical Biology and Biological Chemistry (bio-imaging, radiochemistry, photodynamic
therapy-related cancer research and drug discovery) including the Cancer Research centre
and EPSRC Centre for Doctoral training MosMed.
This facility is being funded though an EPSRC Strategic Equipment grant EP/W006340/1
The scope of this contract is for the supply, delivery and installation of the equipment as
detailed in the ITT to the University, with after-sales support and 24 months warranty and
maintenance.

Where support is required for some Families, we want access to this to be local, accessible and make a difference. 

The Family Support and Outreach Service will take a strengths-based approach to working with families, with children 0-19 years (and up to 25 years for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities). It will join up services around the family, supporting them to find solutions to their own problems and giving them the tools they need to sustain the positive changes they make. 

The Family Support and Outreach Service will contribute to Staffordshire's Building Resilient Families & Communities (BRFC) programme. BRFC is Staffordshire's approach to the national Supporting Families Programme. The national programme has been developed by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) in order to improve evidence-based, multi-agency responses and ensure that families who need support get it at the right point, in the right way, as early as possible.  

Staffordshire County Council is seeking to contract with providers who can deliver all elements of the Family Support and Outreach Service.

The purpose of The Family Support and Outreach Service is to deliver three key elements of Service:
 
1.	Referral Based Family Support - offering early help to families to prevent needs from escalating and equipping the family with the skills needed to achieve and sustain positive outcomes.
2.	Targeted Outreach Visits - focused on those families with young children who may benefit from information, advice, guidance and signposting into local community resources and assets.

3.	Support to access community support, groups and Universal Offers and entitlements - offering practical hands-on support to enable families who would not normally access these offers, to help them to engage with available resources and support within their community. 

Staffordshire County Council is particularly interested to hear from providers who can offer support for children and families with more complex, multiple needs.",,,"West Midlands","85000000 ","Claire Teece",commercial.team@staffordshire.gov.uk,"Tipping Street",,STAFFORD,ST162DH,England,01785854657,https://www.staffordshire.gov.uk/Business/Procurement/tendering/eProcurement.aspx,"SCC E-Tendering Portal User Guide  22.01.19.pdf ",,,01/04/2022,31/03/2027,02/11/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1800000,14000000,17/01/2022,14000000,"[Malachi Specialist Family Support Services CIC|Billesley Ark

Birmingham City Council (The Council) wishes to raise awareness of the causes of air pollution and the steps that can be taken to reduce emissions and exposure. To achieve this aim, the Council is pursuing a range of projects. 
      
      This particular project is aimed towards children and parents via the installation of 70 indicative air quality sensors onto the exterior façades of a number of schools (mix of primary and secondary). One sensor will be deployed per school per Council Ward (there are 69 Wards in Birmingham, Appendix 3 provides a list and map of Birmingham Wards). For each school identified by the Council, a sensor will be deployed along with a static signage board with information and links to online resources, which are in the process of being developed. 
       
      The Council requires 70 real-time indicative air quality sensors for deployment commencing in January 2022. All 70 sensors must be in place by the end of April 2022 (if not earlier). There are 69 Council Wards within Birmingham, one sensor will be deployed per Ward with a final sensor to be deployed alongside one of the Council's real time air quality stations.

work to revise STANAG 2433, more commonly known as AIntP-3, The Military Intelligence Data Exchange 
Concept.

Dstl's work to date has supported the UK custodian in a refresh and update of this standard. As a notable uplift, 
this revision has included an approach enabling machine-to-machine digital exchange of records following the 
logical approach within that standard. This work has been completed and the custodian has submitted it formally 
to the NATO group that owns this standard, following which a number of comments have been received.

In addition to documenting the new approach, proof of concept testing work has also taken place. This testing 
involved exchange between a reference AIntP-3 system developed under this work and a version of NEBULA 
from the ODYSSEY programme. During the test, a simple scenario using examples of AIntP-3 formatted data 
was imported into NEBULA and the data was presented to a user. The data was then modified and exported 
back to the originator.

The work is:
- To enhance the existing AIntP-3 to NEBULA test system to offer a 
component to NEBULA providing AIntP-3 interoperability.
- Ongoing support to aid JU in their efforts to get JINTWG approval for the revised standards, as well as supporting subsequent efforts to push the standard through NATO ratification processes.",,"SP4 0JQ",,"73000000 ","Commercial CIS Transparency",commercialcistransparency@dstl.gov.uk,"Porton Down",,SALISBURY,SP40JQ,England,,,"Serapis_TaskingForm_U68_REDACTED.pdf 20220210 Actual Procurement Timescales.pdf ",,,14/01/2022,15/03/2022,01/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,44133.52,,13/01/2022,44133.52,"[FRAZER-NASH CONSULTANCY LIMITED|Stonebridge House,The Dorking Business Park Station Road

The Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) card is a prerequisite for employment on building sites.  The course to obtain it is popular with young people, particularly with the Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) cohort. Currently, due to funding issues, there is limited availability for 16-19 year-olds to complete this course without paying for it themselves. Kent County Council is seeking to provide 100 funded places over a three/four-month period until the European Social Fund begins to fund this activity. Each course will offer 10 places.
Kent County Council expects courses will be delivered in 6 locations with places for 10 young people in each course.  Each location will be one lot. Bidders may bid for as many lots as they like.  There will be 10 young people per cohort, and within lots 1-4 there must be 2 courses running, therefore will have 20 young people each lot.
Bidders will be working closely with the NEET support service to roll out these courses.  They will also support with finding relevant students.  Should bidders not find 10 students, they may seek external referrals from their usual sources.
The delivery provider will be expected to work with the local NEET support service staff to fill the course.

The project should also identify knowledge gaps in extant evidence on gender and biodiversity, identify new evidence to fill the gaps identified, and to develop policy recommendations and potential actions governments and other actors can take to address these issues. Due to persisting gender inequalities, women and men experience the impacts of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss differently.  Heavier reliance on natural resources, differences in the rights and access to land, biological resources and ecosystem services, and gender-based differences and inequalities (or gaps) which stem from cultural norms which tend to favour men, mean that the impacts of biodiversity loss are felt more acutely by women.  This is particularly true of women from underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds who face multiple inequalities exacerbating effects on health and livelihoods.  However, the existing literature on the gendered impacts of environmental degradation for both developed and developing countries focuses largely on the links between gender and climate change. There is a lack of evidence addressing the links between gender and biodiversity loss/environmental degradation across a range of topics, including differential outcomes and the inclusion of women and other marginalised groups in developing solutions. It is crucial for policy makers to better understand how their domestic and international actions and policies can exacerbate these unequal impacts in their own and developing countries.To better understand the current body of evidence and ensure this is mainstreamed into our international negotiations and policy at multilateral fora, DEFRA is looking to fund a report reviewing the existing evidence (synthesising it and identifying knowledge gaps), source new evidence to address the gaps identified and propose policy",,,London,"73210000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"FINAL IIED Contract - The gendered impact of biodiversity loss REDACTED 0902.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,24/01/2022,31/03/2022,28/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,17/01/2022,40613,"[International Institute for Environment and Development|Third Floor, 235 High Holborn, London, Greater London, WC1V 7DN, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,24/01/2022,31/03/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,14:00

The first workstream will assess the impact and effectiveness of existing commodity certification schemes as a means to ensure positive environmental outcomes. It will identify how the environmental impacts of key commodities driving deforestation differ between goods produced to internationally recognised sustainability standards and those which are not, and rank the effectiveness of schemes against benchmarking criteria for certified goods, e.g. for sustainable palm oil the criteria defined by the UK Roundtable on Sourcing Sustainable Palm Oil.

It is a largely derelict former industrial area with vacant brownfield land predominantly in South Tyneside Council ownership.

The existing site contains potential constraints associated with historical land uses which could impact on future development. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

•	Derelict riverside quay structures
•	Buried quayside infrastructure (old river walls, crane foundations etc.)
•	Extensive Functional Flood Zone - land to be raised to a level to allow reclassification with reduced flood risk
•	Sub-surface obstructions (shallow and deep / piled structures) and buried chambers
•	Ground contamination
•	Old retaining walls
•	Surface hard standings
•	Underground services
•	Significant variation in ground profiles and elevations across the site

To address these issues and ameliorate risk to future development, South Tyneside Council intend to implement a programme of Site Enabling Works where the site is regraded to an approximate 1:30 slope, unserviced and ready for follow-on mixed-use development incorporating residential dwellings and new offices. 

Works are anticipated to commence in September 2021 and last 18-21 months.

Brief Description of Requirement

Focusing on CEM's that are to be used on early-stage LV design activities (e.g. Phase 0-A) and for LV architectures that are capable of delivering up to 8000 kg to LEO, the supplier shall perform the following:  

1.	Critically review the existing CEMs currently used in industry and/or with the potential to be adapted to assess modern small/medium LV life-cycle costs as well as their cost-based price per flight. The review should highlight their applicability to the different stages of vehicle design maturity, outline analysis method gaps and limitations and further discuss their sensitivities to major cost drivers. Regarding the cost drivers, at a minimum the study should consider sensitivities to: launch vehicle architecture, development testing, manufacturing base, learning curve, launch site operations, and inflation.

2.	Perform a trade of the identified LV life-cycle cost approaches and select the most promising options to take forward for application on small/medium LVs.

3.	Develop either a prototype cost software program or a detailed cost modelling approach. These should detail extensions and/or modifications to existing CEMs based on the most promising options identified in Task 2.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the ability to monitor abrupt structural vegetation change in UK upland environments through combining Sentinel 1 with Sentinel 2 derived data. This change can occur due to both cutting and burning (managed burning and wildfires). 
This work is to help understand and monitor the impact of changes, especially managed burning and wildfires to support policy development relating to protected site, Net Zero, the 25 year Environment Plan, and England Peat Action Plan. This evidence will help Natural England and Defra meet requirements to understand change in management on moorland with peat soils in response to regulatory changes and policy initiatives.  
Using remotely sensed data will allow a national picture of change to be developed with improved spatial and temporal detail. This will help inform:
-	The scale, distribution and frequency of change activities. 
-	An understanding of compliance with regulation and behaviour change in response to regulation
-	Damage caused by wildfires to habitats and wildlife on protected sites and areas of deep peat. 
-	Good land management practices and behaviours that could be promoted to reduce the likelihood or impact of wildfires into the future.",,,London,"73210000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Environment Systems Ltd Contract - Upland Burn Redacted_Redacted.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,17/01/2022,14/03/2022,22/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,17/01/2022,27400,"[Environment Systems Ltd|9 Cefn Llan Science Park, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3AH, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,17/01/2022,14/03/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

On behalf of UK Space Command, Defence Equipment and Support is seeking to procure a modular, event driven fully data representative satellite simulator for use in design, development, integration, test and operation of space segment assets; this will be used in support of the ARTEMIS mission. ARTSIM, as the baseline deliverable, will provide a set of generic default satellite configurations which can be used for the analysis of a range of mission operations and capability objectives. The system must take a flexible, distributed architecture approach, providing for a range of spacecraft components to be simulated to a level of fidelity which can be determined by the team utilising the tool. The system shall utilise high quality GUI and animations to visualise satellite and orbit configurations.MOD require the capability to deploy ARTSIM as a stand-alone software process,running on a single machine, or as a VM deployed on a hypervisor, or as a cloud based application running in a container.Simulation of the satellite systems, subsystems and interfaces in both real-time and simulated time, will provide an operationally ready capability, which is able to represent, as simulation instances, a range of satellite implementations (including constellations), with a full range of orbit configurations. ARTSIM shall enable user(local or remote) control of the simulation including setting parameters and starting/stopping the simulation. ARTSIM shall have a set of default underlying functions, but also enable user definition of system mathematical models including orbit function, satellite function and unit models. ARTSIM shall include interface connectivity functionality, enabling connection to hardware through electrical interfacing to support in the loop testing via a test harness. Software interfacing shall enable connection to external databases, networks or remote control i.e. TT&C databases and external Check-out systems The ARTSIM product shall support the simulation of system level configurations in the different mission phases (off-launcher separation, and solar panel deployment),definition of the reference systems, the functional block diagrams of the satellite,payload and equipment layouts and functional paths.The ARTSIM product shall support the development and understanding of satellite level system budgets including:- mass,- inertial properties,- unit power consumption for all operational modes,- power available in different mission phases.",,"NE66 2GD","North East","73410000 ","Amy Ford",Amy.Ford398@mod.gov.uk,"Ministry of Defence, DE&S, Abbey Wood",,Bristol,"BS34 8JH",England,,,"20220117-FCG017_Satellite Simulator_Contract_Offer_Terms_and_conditions_701165385 v3 REDACTED.docx ",,"https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/notice/5d6b7e7a-a6aa-4b97-a63b-a1ee29a2d4c6?origin=SearchResults&p=1

The Authority has secured funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to support delivery of the Killingworth Site Sustainable Retrofit Project. This project is a combination of refurbishment and replacement of existing office accommodation, workshop, welfare and other facilities on the site ensuring it 'future proofs' depot operations. Energy efficiency and functionality are key principles, and the Project will use a wide range of energy efficient, generation and storage/distribution solutions to support a move to an electric powered operational fleet whilst reducing the site carbon footprint. This procurement opportunity relates specifically to Block F Vehicle Maintenance Workshop Refurbishment and North Tyneside Council will act as Principal Contractor for the project, therefore tenderers should note that they will be working in the capacity of Sub-Contractor. Tenderers must be aware that this is an operational building and as such works must be undertaken taking into consideration the ongoing workshop operations which will require work phasing and innovative delivery solutions to ensure disruption to the service is kept to a minimum. We expect tenderers to liaise closely with the service and out of hours and weekend working will at times be necessary. The Block F site is very restrictive for access / plant movements and therefore it is strongly recommended that Tenderers undertake a site visit, contact details to make arrangements are contained within the Preambles document in the tender pack. Tenderers will be required to confirm that they will comply will the Authority's minimum standards in relation to health & safety and mandatory training requirements. All operatives must hold CSCS cards, relevant training certification and any other trade/task specific relevant qualifications.

UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) on behalf of The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), wishes to establish a Framework for the provision of Office for Product Safety & Standards (OPSS) Strategic Research Programme.

UK SBS is managing this procurement process in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (as amended) (the ""Regulations"").

The duration of this Framework will be 48 Months (From award until Friday 3rd October 2025).

It is intended that there will be 3 suppliers awarded to this Framework. These awarded suppliers will be ranked 1st 2nd and 3rd based of the scores awarded from this completion of this procurement.

Background:

This contract is being commissioned as part of the Office for Product Safety & Standards (OPSS) Strategic Research Programme. OPSS was established by BEIS in January 2018 in order to enhance protections for consumers and drive forward increased productivity, growth and business confidence. The OPSS strategic research programme provides high quality, strategic, science-based research to strengthen the evidence base for OPSS policy development, delivery and enforcement.

In recent months it has been necessary to seek consumer insight on a number of issues such as the recall of large white goods and purchase and use of certain consumer products in relation to Covid-19. It is expected that further issues will arise where consumer insight can help shape the OPSS response. In addition to this OPSS has recently taken on regulation of construction products, presenting a new research area where consumer insight could add value.

The Council has a dedicated PCi network for the card taking process and has moved its card taking application into a Cloud environment thereby reducing the scope of PCi requirements.

wellbeing support services.

The service will include the following core elements:
• Single Point of Entry (""One Front Door"") and an online website with information and resources
• One-to-one support sessions
• Peer-led groups
• Wellbeing and resilience workshops
• Outreach and signposting
• 24/7 helpline, webchat and online support (e-mental health service)

The Mental Health Helpline element is also available to Coventry residents and links to Coventry services. Coventry and Warwickshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) make a funding contribution towards the provision of the 24/7 helpline to Coventry residents.
The approach of delivery will be community-first and outcome-focused. It is envisaged that ""One Front Door"" (Single Point of Entry) is offered to simplify access into the pool of services that are operating under a shared visual identity/brand, through a Collaborative Partnership model. The Collaborative Partnership will need to work with commissioners, referrers, and service users in service mobilisation to agree the shared visual identity/brand.  
Providers may still use their own logos and branding to compliment this but branding guidelines should be created jointly to ensure the ""One Front Door"" is effective and individuals do not feel confused where to go.

This should be informed by the current trees policy landscape and the CCC recommendations.

This project seeks a supplier to develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for the NCF Trees Programme.

The NCF and its funding of the ETAP aims to secure environmental, economic, and social outcomes as set out in the 25 Year Environment Plan. Part of this is enabling nature's recovery, to which woodlands and trees are crucial. 

In order to ensure that the NCF is successful in achieving its key commitments and targets and those of the ETAP, it is essential that outputs are effectively monitored and evaluated. We required an M&E framework to be developed and a comprehensive M&E programme and report to be subsequently delivered to enable scrutiny of NCF delivery, monitor progress towards objectives and evaluate impact.

The project must develop a robust approach to evaluating the actions taken by the NCF Trees Programme and progress towards outcomes outlined in the ETAP, in line with evaluation best practice and HMT Magenta book guidance. The ongoing delivery of the M&E programme will be undertaken by Defra Arm's Length Bodies.

Home Care provides support to enable and re-able people to live as independently as possible, including help with day to day living at home, through direct support, assistive technology equipment and adaptations that can help to make life easier, maintain independence and health and wellbeing.

Caring and compassionate support is provided by local ethical care providers who are passionate and dedicated to working in an asset-based way ensuring individuals live the life they choose and can fulfil their aims and ambitions.  

We want to work with providers who are experts at proactively maximising community connections; developing relationships; ensuring access to leisure and culture; promoting good health and wellbeing; supporting individuals into volunteering and employment opportunities; and developing people's confidence and independence.

A transformed model of Ethical Home Care services has been established to support the development of deeper connections and relationships within the local area, maximising opportunities for providers to work with local people and organisations to reduce social isolation, increase recruitment, attracting staff who would like to live and work in their local area, connecting people's assets and interests with local activities and opportunities.

To support this transformation, services have been separated into 16 areas.  Providers will be accountable for providing support within their defined area.

EDAUS will follow a Subscription / Publisher model. Changes in DWP's Systems of Record will generate events which will be acted on by EDAUS. Where a Consumer has subscribed to receive updates to data, the EDAUS service will generate a file containing the updated data for each event that occurs.

.
• Support families;
• Provide stable, safe effective alternative care at the right time and for the right length of
time and which are responsive to individual needs, circumstances and choice;
• Maintain wherever possible continuity of educational provision.
.
In meeting these aims and objectives, Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council will work to secure 'sufficient accommodation' as required by Section 22G of the Children Act, 1989 (as inserted by the Children and Young People Act, 2008) which places a general duty on Local Authorities to secure sufficient accommodation within their boundaries to meet the needs of Looked After Children.
.
To meet the sufficiency challenge in Rotherham and to provide a more balanced and sustainable placement mix we are investing in a Digital Marketing Service to increase the amount of in-house Foster Carers within RMBC. 
.
Our vision is to recruit an additional 45 Foster Carers a year with the Foster Carer Recruitment - Digital Marketing Service being central to helping us achieve this; working in close partnership with the Rotherham Fostering Service and key stakeholders across RMBC.
.
The aim of the service is to:
.
• increase the amount of approved Foster Carers for RMBC to meet current and future sufficiency requirements for looked after children
.
The objective of the service is to:
.
• develop and deliver a marketing and engagement strategy utilising a range of media channels to create a broad pipeline of prospective Foster Carers for Rotherham.
.
• Provide marketing and data insight and expertise to support the existing Fostering Service, supporting the development of a clear evidence-based Foster Carer recruitment journey 
.
On that note RMBC are looking to tender for these services.
.
It is anticipated that the contract will commence on 01/04/2022 and will run for a period of three years making the expiry date 31/03/2025.

JJ2/1121,Contract,"The Committee On Climate Change",Awarded,2022-01-18T13:31:25Z,"Understanding the costs and impacts of potential approaches to providing electric vehicle charging for households without private off-street parking","The Government has recently announced that all new sales of conventional petrol and diesel light-duty vehicles must end by 2030, with hybrids also phased out by 2035. By this point, the car market will need to transition to all new sales being zero-carbon, we expect electric, vehicles (EVs). Moreover, in our advice on the Sixth Carbon Budget, the CCC emphasised that this transition must focus on fully electric battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), with only a minimal role for hybrids beyond 2030 as they often produce high levels of GHG emissions in real-world use.

Under the CCC's Balanced Net Zero Pathway scenario for the Sixth Carbon Budget, BEV sales ramp up steadily through the 2020s, reaching 97% of all new car sales by 2030. This leads to around 12.5 million BEV cars being on-the-road by 2030, rising to almost 25 million by 2035. This level of uptake will increase the demand for electricity across the road transport sector from below 1 TWh per year today to over 100 TWh by 2050. In order to deliver this power to their vehicles, all car users will need reliable and convenient access to charging infrastructure into which they can plug their cars.

      The Green Tunnels are cut and cover tunnels, which consist, in brief, in excavating a trench, constructing the tunnel in it, and backfilling it afterwards, to restore the ground surface to its original state. By integrating the railway into the existing landscape, this tunnelling method contributes in mitigating potential impacts that it could have, particularly in rural areas, such as visual pollution and wildlife fragmentation. For this reason, the Green Tunnels have been proposed as a sustainable solution for some sections of the HS2 route.
      
      Requirement
      
      EKFB are looking for a competent supplier to carry out a suitable and sufficient Fire Risk Assessment of the tunnels to identify the risks and manage them appropriately. 
      The scope of works includes, but is not limited to: assessing fire sources, confirming the minimum requirements and the specific requirements for the case, defining the risk level, proposing actions to manage these safely and effectively, commenting on the spread of fire in the tunnel and its surroundings, developing fire strategies, incident management plans, emergency plans, and any other applicable documentation. 
      
      Amount of Tunnels & Location
