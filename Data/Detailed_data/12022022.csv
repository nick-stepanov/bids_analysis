This forms part of the wider Community Sentence Treatment Requirements (CSTRs) Programme which is a partnership between the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE/I), Public Health England (PHE) and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS).  

The CSTR Programme aims to develop pathways to enable and facilitate the increased use of all three treatment requirements:
-	Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTRs)
-	Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs)
-	Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATRs)

ATRs and DRRs in the South East were outside the scope of this procurement, beyond the co-ordination of CSTRs for combined orders. However, there is an expectation that MHTR and ATR & DTR providers will work closely together in the best interests of the service user, especially where it can be identified that a combined order is the best outcome.

MHTR in the context of the CSTR programme is intended for the sentencing of individuals convicted of an offence(s) which has crossed the community order sentencing threshold and may be bused as an alternative to short custodial sentences for individuals who may have range of mental health, personality disorder and psychological issues/vulnerabilities which do not require forensic or secondary care treatment.

The aims of the service are to:
•	Increase the proportion of offenders with mental health issues for whom an effective mental health treatment plan is in place.
•	Reduce re-offending by addressing the underlying causes of offending behaviour. 
•	Prevent custodial sentences (especially short ones), by offering robust community treatment options.
•	Provide tailored mental health support to the most vulnerable offenders. Individuals supported by pilot sites included those who suffered from post-traumatic stress, trauma, bipolar, personality and phobia disorders, psychosis and ASD. 

Lot 1 (Reading Magistrates Court and Oxford Combined Court) and Lot 2 (Southampton Magistrates Court and Portsmouth Magistrates Court) were awarded as part of this procurement. 

Lot 3 (Guildford Magistrates Court), Lot 4 (Brighton Magistrates Court) and Lot 5 (Maidstone Combined Court) were not awarded. 

The contract for Lot 1 (Reading Magistrates Court and Oxford Combined Court) commenced on 01 April 2022.

The contracts are for an initial term of 3 years, with a possible extension of a further three years, as defined and at the discretion of the Commissioner.  

Services commenced on 01 July 2022, with the exception of Reading Magistrates Court in Lot 1 which commenced on 01 April 2022. 

The initial contract term for Lot 1 will be 3 years and 3 months to account for the earlier service commencement date for Reading Magistrates Court.",,,"South East","85100000 ","Evan Williams",Scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"Jubilee House, 5510 John Smith Drive, Oxford Business Park",,Oxford,"OX4 2LH",England,,,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/ProjectManage/1420 ","Secondary MHTRs were outside the scope of this service specification and its provision should be provided through locally commissioned frameworks for secondary care.

Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

The floor, laid by others, will comprise of a new 175mm beam and block floor over the existing floor void, overlaid with 1000-gauge polythene dpm and 160mm PIR Insulation Board.  Above this will be a 500-gauge polythene vapour barrier on which a 75mm thick screed slab will be laid. 

Tenders are to include for supply and installation of all elements necessary to produce a fully functioning, effective and reliable system, notably: 

•	Supply and installation of the (water filled) underfloor heating pipes to c.430m2 of the ground floor area (see included plan appendix 1 in attached document), fixed to the vapour barrier/insulation layer using the manufacturer's proprietary fixing/clipping system and to a competent design submitted with/as part of the tender.

•	A full pipe layout/design drawing. 

•	All necessary manifolds, buffer cylinder(s), expansion vessel(s) and other ancillaries associated with the underfloor piping system and their connection to the heat pump. 

•	Pressure testing of the completed pipework and manifold system prior to the pouring of the concrete screed slab. 

•	Supply and installation of the gas condensing boiler, and connection to the external gas supply.

•	All necessary controls, interconnecting pipework, interconnecting cables/wiring, tray work, etc. necessary for the full functioning of the heating system.

Brief Description of Requirement

BEIS has been contributing to Ofcom's Utilities Spectrum Strategy project, which has the objective to determine what, if any, spectrum management or regulatory intervention will be needed to help utilities deliver their services to 2050. BEIS notes that Ofcom's modelling work indicates that across all cases the total data rate for the energy sector will increase through to 2040. Industry has expressed a view that the need to better monitor and control their networks cannot be met through existing narrowband connectivity solutions, and require enhanced, broadband communications. The purpose of this work is to assess the risks (across different parts/assets of the energy network) of this new demand not being met from existing connectivity solutions (and public mobile networks) and where material risks are identified whether some form of alternative solution such as fixed line, spectrum allocation (shared or dedicated) and/or a dedicated network is likely to be required.

The key strategic outcomes of the project are to:

•	Provide BEIS with a view on those energy use cases where there is a risk that existing and developing communications solutions may impede the delivery of BEIS wider objectives for the energy system (and where intervention may be required).
•	Where risks are as identified as material how these might be mitigated. This should include an assessment for each use case of what future communication options might be required (including fully wired solutions to wireless solutions using 'new' spectrum (shared or dedicated) and technology - noting where spectrum would need to support the technology. This mitigation plan should also consider the cost and barriers to the achievability of candidate mitigation options.

Cambridgeshire require a sensor network that will enable us to monitor traffic types and volumes at defined points around the region. A framework/call off agreement is required to ensure that we can install a core network of sensors in the first instance, with the option for our local authority partners to be able to procure additional sensors at a set price as required. Maintenance/Support of the network should be included in the costs for a minimum four-year period with a possibility to extend by a further 2 years. 
This length of contract is required to cover an extended maintenance contract for similar sensors; the type of sensors required have a typical lifespan of around 6 years and therefore the contract need to have the option to run for this time. we too would like to buy them with an annual maintenance fee for a 6 year period if suitable (dependent on the successful suppliers equipment). 

This requirement is not split into Lots, as the Authority requires one provider for ease of management and volume efficiencies.  

This framework is open for use by the following bodies: 

•	Cambridgeshire County Council 
•	Combined Peterborough and Cambridgeshire Authority (CPCA) 
•	Greater Cambridge Partnership 
•	 Peterborough City Council 
•	 Cambridge City Council
•	South Cambridgeshire District Council
•	East Cambridgeshire District Council
•	Huntingdonshire District Council
•	Fenland District Council 


The estimated value of this procurement is between £200,000 and £800,00, depending on the availability of funding and the take-up by the various organisations listed above.

There will be no guarantee of work or volume of work to be given under this framework.

Brief Description of Requirement
The UKRI Board are committed to collecting evidence to understand the impacts of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) Accelerating Detection of Disease Challenge, (ADD). Bids are invited for an evaluation of this programme to gain insight into the outcomes and impact in the context of the UK and global landscape.
The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is part of the Government's Industrial Strategy, the long-term plan to raise productivity and earning power in the UK. The fund is a core pillar in the government's commitment to increase funding in research and development by £4.7 billion over 4 years to strengthen UK science and business. It is focussed on investing in the world-leading research base and highly innovative businesses to address the biggest industrial and societal challenges today.
The Challenge will seek additional consent for active engagement with participants, through the provision of feedback to inform participants of their risk status, any clinically actionable results and opportunities for early intervention. Participants will also be invited to consent to be contacted about future clinical trials which may be of relevance to their risk profile. 

The Delivery is split across three phases: 
Phase 1: Establishment - Objective is to mitigate risks to the programme and develop a robust operating model through trialling multiple approaches to cohort recruitment and data establishment. 
Phase 2: Implementation - Objective is to practically demonstrate that the operating model will effectively deliver the challenge aims.  
Phase 3: Scaling - Objective is to take lessons from phase 2 to scale the participant cohorts and deliver a sustainable cohort resource data.",,"SN2 1FL",,"73200000 79300000 ","Karl Oakley",professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,"01793 867000",www.uksbs.co.uk,,,,11/02/2022,31/03/2025,19/11/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Products,0,482000,11/02/2022,474447.53,"[IPSOS MORI UK LIMITED|3 Thomas More Square

Ofqual has established a Ways of Working project to manage our transition to new and different ways of working following the pandemic, and in the wake of the effect of cancelled exams and assessments on Ofqual as an organisation. In addition to wanting to work differently, we now need to embrace a hybrid-working model as we no longer have enough desks given the amount of organisational growth that's happened over the last 18 months. Ofqual is also due to be assessed, in Spring 2022, against the Government Property Agency's (GPA) Smarter Working Maturity Matrix which has been designed to support and enable other government programmes and initiatives such as Places for Growth and Beyond Whitehall strategies. Those strategies ultimately aim to achieve a goal of making the Civil Service a great place to work that attracts and retains great talent within government.
The Ways of Working project is large and important, and will have an impact on every member of staff, and in turn on those we regulate, and on those we regulate on behalf of. It's proving to be a challenging piece of work in that we know there is not a consensus view on what the future should look like. It's also a sensitive time, given the enduring nature of the pandemic. While we work through the detail of our approach, clear and constant communication is critical to ensuring colleagues feel engaged and that they understand what's happening and why it's happening, so they can play their part at the right time. This particular project - the communications and change management in support of the wider project - will provide:
the final draft of Ofqual's Working Practices Policy ready for internal sign off
a defined implementation approach for the policy - 'how' the change will be implemented successfully
an implementation plan - 'what' needs to be done to implement the change successfully
a full assessment of the impact on staff at team level, including any skills and knowledge gaps
training plans as required
change readiness assessments and plans communications and engagement plan including both internal and external.
These deliverables add up to a comprehensive change management and communications package to support and guide the implementation of Ofqual's new ways of working.",,,"West Midlands","72221000 ","Commercial Department",procurement@ofqual.gov.uk,"Earlsdon Park","53-55 Butts Rd",Coventry,"CV1 3BH",England,"'+44 2476716830",http://ofqual.gov.uk,,"https://www.mytenders.co.uk/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=MAR163904 ",,08/02/2022,31/03/2022,01/01/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,28500,,07/02/2022,28500,"[Fosterhill Associates Limited|The Stables, Money Farm, Mattingley, Hook|COMPANIES_HOUSE|06531744|No|No]",,08/02/2022,31/03/2022,"Open ",,00:00

Brief Description of Requirement:

The Transforming UK Food Systems Programme is one of the 34 programmes in the Strategic Priorities Fund (SPF) portfolio. The SPF builds on Sir Paul Nurse's vision of a 'common fund', as recommended in his independent review of the Research Councils, to ensure that strategically important research and innovation which is not aligned with other funding programmes can seek direct support.   

The SPF is funded through the government's National Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF). with a combined total investment across the portfolio of around £830million.

A competitive fund, the SPF has the following objectives:  

•	Drive an increase in high-quality interdisciplinary research and innovation;  
•	Ensure that UKRI's investment links up effectively with Government departments' research priorities and opportunities; and  
•	Ensure the system is able to respond to strategic priorities and opportunities.

KENT001-DN584185-09112190,Contract,"Kent County Council",Awarded,2022-03-02T13:21:38Z,"Home Study Support (Virtual)","Children and Young People have missed a significant amount of learning during the pandemic. Therefore, Kent County Council are looking to procure a service that delivers high quality support for home study by providing on-line access from a qualified teacher and teaching assistant/facilitator during classes delivered after school.
The service will be responsive to demand and student participation, and as such may be required to change planned delivery classes e.g., maths to be replaced with a science lesson or other subject on a temporary basis. 
The objectives for both Key Stages we are seeking to achieve are:
•	Provide real time support to pupils with their home learning to enable them to tackle challenges rather than fail to answer/attempt.
•	Enable those who want to get ahead with their learning to do so to do so.
•	To help children regain lost learning.
•	To provide an additional resource to assist schools help children plug targeted learning gaps.
•	Improve the confidence of Children and Young People in English and Maths.
•	Provide assist families to be able to support their child's learning when parents themselves do not have the confidence in subject knowledge to support child sufficiently.

Classes will be open to pupils in all Kent state funded schools (approximately 600). There are approximately 36,000 pupils in years 5 and 6 combined (Key Stage 2), and 33,000 in Key Stage 4.
It will be voluntary for children to attend these classes which will take the form of ""pop in"" classes. They will be virtual in a webinar format to ensure appropriate safeguards can be in place to protect pupils and staff. 
Each class must have a teacher and at least 1 teaching assistant/facilitator.  
The teacher and teaching assistant/facilitator will be visible, but pupils' cameras will be turned off, unless otherwise agreed by the Council. 
Children will post their queries/homework question in the chat and the teacher/teaching assistant/facilitator will take each in turn to help the child(ren) better understand what they need to do. Pupils' microphones should be switched off by default and pupils should not have the capacity to talk to each other nor send private messages to each other or the staff. The teacher/teaching assistant/facilitator may unmute a child's microphone to enable the child and teacher /teaching assistant/facilitator to speak as part of the public session, for example to enable the child to ask their question verbally. This is to ensure inclusivity, understanding, and to make the classes more vibrant. The provider will need to ensure there is appropriate moderation safeguards in place for both the chat function and managing microphones.

The provider will need to enable parental registration via a website. A link can be circulated to parents via our schools. The registration process needs to confirm parental consent for their child's participation. It will also gather information as to which Kent school the child attends.",,,"South East","80100000 80110000 80200000 ","Sam Wright",sam.wright@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,22/02/2022,08/07/2022,09/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,61460,,11/02/2022,108084,"[Invicta National Academy|12 Old Bexley Lane

Publication OJS Number 2020\\S 081-192474 Contract Finder Notice Reference DORST001-DN454600-05067034

The Council are looking to reopen and expand our Short Break Provider framework (set up in 2020) to extend the number of suitable service providers offering a range of varied short break opportunities for children, young people and their carers across Dorset.

Short Breaks for Children, Young People and Young Adults who are Disabled are focused on delivering and developing services for 0 - 25-year-olds.
This tender is about putting in place a range of Targeted and Specialist Short Break opportunities throughout the County (Dorset).
Short breaks are when a child or young person has planned time apart from their main carer outside school hours, taking part in activities they like, to form and develop friendships and become more confident and independent. Short Breaks allow the child's family to have a break from the demands of caring, to relax and recharge their batteries, to spend time with each other and their other children and to reduce family stress. Short Breaks can take place in a community location, the child's own home, the home of an approved short break carer, or in a residential setting.
Reliability of the provision and support is essential in order that a family can plan ahead. The framework is divided into the two categories detailed below

CATEGORY A: Specialist Services - This is likely to include, but is not limited to, the following: - Residential overnight short breaks - Weekend, after school and holiday short break sessions - Personal Assistant, in-home and community support work.

CATEGORY B: Targeted Services - Services required are likely to include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Outreach one to one services including befriending/buddy/PA schemes (at home or in the community)
- After school, holiday and weekend play, sports and activity sessions for all ages - Activity, day and evening sessions for young people aged 15-18 and/or 18 - 25

To gain entry on to the Framework, Tenderers are required to submit their tender in accordance with the instructions set out in this procurement process.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Future Research Assessment Programme has been initiated at the request of UK and devolved government ministers and funding bodies. This significant piece of work will be led by the four UK higher education funding bodies (Research England, Scottish Funding Council, Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and Department for the Economy, NI) and aims to explore possible approaches to the assessment of UK higher education research performance.

One strand of work will look at the responsible uses of technology-assisted approaches such as artificial-intelligence, machine-learning or metric-driven approaches in research assessment. This will enable the project to investigate possible different approaches to the evaluation of UK higher education research performance, which can encourage and strengthen the emphasis on delivering excellent research and impact, support a positive research culture, while simplifying and reducing the administrative burden on the HE sector. 

To meet this requirement the project shall involve a comprehensive literature review of technology assisted approaches to research assessment, will utilise scores produced from the REF2021 exercise to test experimental approaches, and verify the feasibility of using such approaches responsibly in future research assessment exercises while maintaining the principles of fairness, equality and transparency. 

The primary aim of this piece of work is to review applicable approaches to technology-assisted research assessment and to understand the feasibility of utilising such approaches in supporting the REF and possible future research assessment exercises. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the ITQ document.

Marine mammals are sensitive to this noise, which has the potential to kill, injure or disturb without appropriate mitigation. A key area of concern is impulsive noise, primarily generated when installing turbine foundations. Developers are already required (as part of the consent process) to implement marine mammal mitigation when undertaking these activities, however, it is anticipated that additional mitigation will be needed in the future to reflect increases in the size of turbine generators and their associated foundations; and to manage in-combination effects, which are a major concern given the number of developments required over the next ten years. 

Defra and BEIS are working together to investigate how additional noise mitigation could be used to substantially decrease the amount of underwater noise produced during offshore wind farm construction, and whether the requirement for mitigation should be mandatory. This proposed project is aligned with a Defra project. The Defra project will review existing regulatory processes for offshore wind and consider how piling can be managed and mitigated. It will also summarise available noise reduction options and consider what mitigation may be needed in the future. The BEIS project will review the cost implications of this additional mitigation.",,"SW1H 0ET",,"71313000 72220000 ","Danlu Tong",danlu.tong@beis.gov.uk,"1 Victoria Street",,London,"SW1H 0ET",England,,,"NIRAS-~1.PDF ",,,09/02/2022,31/03/2022,24/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,29977.05,30000,09/02/2022,30000,"[NIRAS GROUP (UK) LTD|Kings Court Ride, Kings Ride, Ascot, Berkshire, SL5 7JR|COMPANIES_HOUSE|01250443|No|No]",,09/02/2022,31/03/2022,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

MT225519,Contract,Ofgem,Awarded,2022-02-23T17:45:11Z,"2021-175 Interconnector Policy Review","On 13 December 2021 Ofgem published its decision on the interconnector policy review.  That decision set out the next steps for GB interconnector regulation for the future, specifically with intent to open a third cap and floor window application round for interconnectors and a cap and floor pilot for multiple-purpose interconnectors (MPIs) in mid-2022.  Ahead of those milestones Ofgem will be finalising details of the process and policy during an implementation period - one of those policy areas is how Ofgem assess the needs case of future interconnectors.
In the cap and floor regime consumer underwrite interconnectors when their revenues fall beneath a floor level, and money is returned to consumers when those revenues fall above the cap.  It is therefore crucial that Ofgem is able to fully understand the impact of future projects on consumer interests.  Ofgem concluded through the interconnector policy review that Ofgem should review and update its needs case assessment framework to reflect the full range of impacts of interconnection.  Ofgem therefore require consultancy support to help develop this framework for assessing new interconnectors and multiple-purpose interconnectors at the initial project assessment (IPA) stage of the cap and floor regime.
Specifically, Ofgem requires:
* An interconnector and MPI needs case assessment framework that enables effective and transparent decision making by Ofgem on whether specific projects should be awarded a cap a...ime.
* Appropriate indicators and detailed methodologies for the assessment of the impact of specific interconnectors and MPI on the following impact categories; market flows of electricity (socio-economic welfare), network costs (reinforcements), system operability impacts (including ancillary services), decarbonisation, flexibility, security of supply, and competition.
* Where possible, these methodologies should enable the quantification and monetisation of the relevant impacts, and the ability to unify those quantified impacts into a cost-benefit analysis.  Where not possible, Ofgem expects this methodology to set out the relevant parameters of individual quantitative or qualitative assessment.
* A recommendation of the roles and responsibilities within the needs case framework within the context of the cap and floor regime IPA.  Specifically, the parties best placed to implement each methodology, for example: Ofgem, independent consultants, the ESO, or the project developer.
* A recommendation of the best data sources to lean to inform those methodologies, for example: public data sets, network planning outputs or information provided by project developers. This should include a definitive list of submission materials from project developers to inform the needs case assessment.
* The needs case framework should clearly set out how the outputs of each methodology should be combined in order to make a decision on whether a project is in consumers' interest.",,,"Any region","09300000 09000000 71314000 79411000 79400000 79410000 79411100 90713000 09310000 ","Lynsey Gordon",procurement2@ofgem.gov.uk,"10 South Colonnade","Canary Wharf",London,"E14 4PU",England,"'+44 2079017000",http://www.ofgem.gov.uk,,"https://www.mytenders.co.uk/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=FEB163836 ",,14/02/2022,13/05/2022,24/01/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,69900,,11/02/2022,69900,"[Ove Arup & Partners Ltd|8 Fitzroy Street, , London|COMPANIES_HOUSE|01312453|No|No]",,14/02/2022,13/05/2022,"Open ",,12:00

Contracts will be for the delivery of learning against the funding the college receives from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) for the Adult Education Budget (AEB) for learners aged 19+. Delivery must meet the regulations outlined in the ESFA Funding Rules. 
Providers should focus on progression outcomes for learners and ensure provision, even at lower levels, is clearly aligned to the needs of employers and growth sectors  as well as supporting the College's rationale for subcontracting which can be found on our website https://www.hrc.ac.uk/about-hrc/partnerships-and-subcontractors 

HRC is seeking providers that can deliver to learners within a 25 mile radius of either of our 2 campuses and all delivery should be completed by 31/07/2022.  Please note that this procurement is for non-devolved ESFA funding only.
This procurement is being run under the ""light touch regime"" and within the timescales set out in the attachments below.

HRC reserves the right not to award contracts based on the outcome of Due Diligence Checks.

Any incomplete or incorrectly completed submissions may be deemed non-compliant, and as a result you may be unable to proceed further in the procurement process.

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the CCS RM6018 Research Market Place DPS framework.

Brief Description of Requirement:

CEOI was initially established in large part to ensure greater UK industrial success in bidding for ESA and other internationally led programmes. In line with the aspirations laid out by the National Space Strategy, however, there is now an increasing imperative to develop the UK's national space programme, so it is necessary to understand the suitability of the existing CEOI format for the present strategic context.

Predominantly, we would like to understand the impact that the CEOI programme has had to date. How well has it met its original success factors, and what impact it has had on the development of the UK EO sector?
The CEOI programme initially sought to judge impact through attendance of representatives of important bodies at CEOI events, such as the number of ESA staff attending CEOI Challenge Workshops, Annual Conferences and Technology Showcase events. In the longer term, the following success factors were envisaged:
•	Access of CEOI technologies to national and international missions (instances where technologies developed through CEOI funding have been selected for use)
•	Access of CEOI technologies to airborne and other experimental campaigns (instances where technologies developed through CEOI funding have taken part in in-flight or in-orbit demonstration, or other notable testing activities)
•	Access to international funding via ESA, EU and other programmes, including quantitative leverage of funding 
•	Access to export opportunities.
•	Spin-out to terrestrial applications - with grant income and revenues where available. 
•	Other national funding obtained (such as via Scottish Enterprise or Innovate UK)",,SN21SZ,,"73200000 79300000 ",,Professionalservices@UKSBS.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,"01793 867005",www.uksbs.co.uk,,,,10/02/2022,14/04/2022,18/01/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,59950,,10/02/2022,59950,"[WARWICK ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT LIMITED|Two Snowhill,Snow Hill Queensway

Traditionally, Dorset Council's Children's Services have engaged with a number of organisations to undertake specific pieces of laboratory testing work related to children's social care (child protection) as well as care proceedings that can meet court deadlines and specifications.
This includes hair strand testing for drug and alcohol use and DNA / Paternity testing.

Mostly such work is mandated by the courts during child protection proceedings.
The laboratory work must meet certain set ISO standards to be valid in court proceedings which are set out in the service specification.

Through a new block contract the Council want to facilitate a structured approach to accessing laboratory testing services to support our staff in their work with children, young people and families and ultimately improve child and family outcomes.

Because of the varied nature of the work emanating from social care staff from across the whole of the Dorset Council area as well as from our legal services team we want to develop a robust contract with a suitably accredited service provider, that is easily accessible and can deliver highly efficient and accurate laboratory tests.

The contract term is for 4 years at a maximum of £40,000 per annum, therefore a Total Contract Value of £160,000.

      The Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council (Sandwell MBC) Permit Scheme has been developed under the powers provided in Part 3 of the TMA, the Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007, the Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) (Amendment) Regulations. and subsequent amendments. The Sandwell permit scheme was brought into effect on 24th June 2019.
      
      Sandwell MBC permits scheme allows the authority to control and coordinate works on the highway undertaken by utility providers and highways authority own schemes (promoters).  Promoters must apply for permission to undertake work, the authority decide whether to grant the permit and identify any restrictions that should be applied (i.e. restrictions on times of day when the work can be carried out)
      Roadworks are a necessity to enable utilities and highway authority works to be carried out in order to renew, improve and install infrastructure.  As this works take up valuable road space it is important that the impact is minimised in terms of congestion and delays on the road network.
      
      The permit scheme is not intended to prevent activities necessary for the maintenance or improvement of the road network or the services running underneath it.  It is designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the interest of the various parties and where possible bring about effective coordination between all of the competing interests.
      
      The authority charges a fee for a permit application (not for in house works). The authority can levy overrun charges where work is not completed within a reasonable time scales and also issue fixed charge penalty notices for non-compliance of the permit conditions or for working without a permit.  The authority can also provide discounts where undertakers collaborate and carry out works at the same time in the same location.  These fees and incentives encourage undertakers to reduce the disruption caused by street works.  
      The Permit Scheme team require visibility on a map cloud-based interface for displaying a variety of datasets including roadworks, temporary traffic management interventions, live road traffic incidents and highways assets. The current contract expires on 31 March 2022.
      We are looking for a system which provides elements detailed in section 2.

The Care Act 2014 then established local authorities' duties in relation to assessing people's needs and their eligibility for publicly funded care and support. The Care Act 2014 makes it clear that local authorities must provide or arrange services that help prevent people developing needs for care and support or delay people deteriorating such that they would need ongoing care and support . This is enshrined in The Care Act 2014 where there are eight elements listed as contributing to a person's wellbeing and all of which can be assisted through an appropriate information and advice service.

The current services are respected by all stakeholders and have been a crucial part of the early intervention and prevention offer supporting older people with free, impartial information and advice with support to access initial and longer-term preventative services. The provision is also valued as a key element on the delivery on the early intervention and prevention agenda by reducing, preventing or delaying the point at which people need long term care and support.

The current service is primarily for older people but if required will support adults from the age of 55 in exceptional circumstances.

1.	The 2019 NHS Long Term Plan set sustainability commitments for the NHS, which are elaborated in the 'Delivering a Net Zero National Health Service' report.

2.	The 2020 'Delivering a Net Zero National Health Service' report committed the NHS to reaching net zero carbon emissions across the emissions that it directly controls by 2040 (with an 80% reduction by 2032) and for its full scope, including its supply chain, by 2045 (with an 80% reduction by 2039). Medicines account for 25% of NHS carbon emissions, 5 percentage points being direct emissions, e.g. from inhalers and anaesthetic gases, and 20% being from other medicines, including those emissions embedded in the medicines supply chain.

3.	Whilst several options exist, it is unclear which methodology is the most practical and usable for the NHS in assessing the carbon footprint of specific medicines, which is essential for determining the next steps in the NHS's strategy to reduce emissions from medicines, particularly those beyond direct emissions from inhalers and anaesthetics. Example of options considered to date:
•	Process mass intensity (PMI) is one methodology of assessing the environmental impact of chemical and pharmaceutical development processes. PMI uses the total mass of input materials required to produce a unit of the target chemical product. It has the advantage of being relatively easy to calculate, where the manufacturing process data is readily available, but has the limitation of being a proxy and still requires manufacturing information
•	Top down economic modelling of medicine supply chains assumes the same intensity of carbon emissions per unit of monetary value. This homogeneity assumption is a well-known limitation of input/output modelling.
4.	There is limited information available on emissions from active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and the manufacture of them. It is important to note that the API is only one component that contributes to the emissions of medicine manufacturing - many other chemicals and processes could be used in medicine manufacture, which must also be included in the assessment of emissions per medicine.

5.	There are broader impacts of the production and manufacture of medicines on the environment. The focus of this methodology must be carbon emissions (CO2e), but broader environmental impacts should also be considered to avoid unintended environmental consequences.

6.	A number of factors must be taken into account when defining medicines related policy measures to reduce carbon emissions. It is critical that any change in policy results in no diminution in patient outcome (ideally an improvement in patient outcomes will be realised). Other factors such as financial impact or supply chain resilience must also be considered.

The objective of this project is therefore to understand the best approach to assess carbon emissions from specific medicines or groups of medicines (e.g. by class)",,"LS2 7UE",England,"85100000 ","Andrew Powell",andrew.powell14@nhs.net,"Quarry House",,Leeds,"LS2 7UE","United Kingdom",07970786424,,,,,10/02/2022,10/05/2022,14/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,48000,50000,10/02/2022,48000,"[Carbon Trust Advisory Limited|4th Floor Dorset House, 27-45 Stamford Street, London, SE1 9NT, London, SE1 9NT|NONE||No|No]",,10/02/2022,10/05/2022,"CompetitiveQuotationNonOJEU ",,12:00

The report will outline the current roles businesses play in shaping the UK pathway to net zero and assess policy levers for accelerating the positive actions businesses can take. It will include an assessment of the UK Government's plans to require UK listed companies and financial institutions to publish 'transition plans'. 

To inform the CCC's assessment and recommendations, the CCC is tendering some work to set out what a transition plan should include, to assess the options for monitoring and governing transition plans, and to appraise how transition plans might ensure appropriate emissions reduction ambition. The work is envisaged as a think piece rather than a detailed modelling exercise.

 Our vision for children and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) is the same as for all children and young people - that they achieve well in their early years, at school and beyond; they find employment where that&apos;s appropriate; and lead happy, healthy and fulfilled lives which they have choices and control over the support provided to them.

 The SEND Review was announced in September 2019. It is a fundamental and cross-government review looking at how to improve the SEND system so that provides more consistent, high quality, and integrated SEND services across education, health and care. It is also considering measures to make sure that money is being spent fairly, efficiently and effectively, and that the support available to children and young people is sustainable in the future. 
 We are working with children, young people, their families and experts across education, health and care to deliver our common goal of improving the SEND system. We will publish the review as soon as it is practicable to do so. 

 As the SEND review outcome is not yet known, we need to lay the foundations upon which these reforms can be built, ensuring that, through our Delivering Better Value in SEND programme, we are able to build the capacity and capability in the system to begin to address existing challenges and pressures in anticipation of wider reforms.",,,"Any region","80000000 80340000 ",,SendBaea.COMMERCIAL@education.gov.uk,"Sanctuary Buildings, Great Smith Street",,London,"SW1P 3BT",England,,,"DBV Framework Contract - Redacted.pdf ",,,04/01/2022,29/04/2022,15/11/2021,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,1494993.64,,07/02/2022,1494993.64,"[IMPOWER Consulting Ltd|181 Queen Victoria St, London EC4V 4EG|COMPANIES_HOUSE|03876501|No|No]",,04/01/2022,29/04/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

To date, there is no widely accepted protocols for the extraction and detection of microplastics in environmental compartments (sediment, biota and water). Cefas has developed a fast screening method for microplastics in environmental compartments but is currently lacking the capability for particle characterisation for the smaller sized items (below 500 m in size). This capability is required for the accurate investigation in microplastic concentrations and composition that is essential to assess their behaviour in the environment and the risks for biota and human health related to exposure. Tight deadlines to deliver national and international projects is creating an urgent necessity to process samples quickly to cope with the high volume. However, gains in time-efficiency in the data acquisition have usually resulted in a reducing spatial resolution. Therefore, the ability to rapidly process whilst maintaining accuracy and spatial resolution is a critical requirement for this application.

As a result, the marine litter team at Cefas Lowestoft Laboratory requires a 2x fully motorised micro-FTIR's in order to carry out analysis on microplastics particles. The units will be housed at the University of Belize and Department for the Environment (addresses below) and therefore will required to be delivered and installed in Belize. The main objective is the quantification and characterisation of extracted particles onto filters from sediment, biota and water samples quickly, efficiently and accurately.",,,"Any region","38510000 ",,procure@cefas.co.uk,"Pakefield Road",,Lowestoft,"NR33 0HT",England,,www.cefas.co.uk,"CEFAS21-138 Contract for the Provision of Goods and Services (Signed)_Redacted.pdf ",,,09/02/2022,08/02/2023,14/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Products,186000,,07/02/2022,186000,"[Bruker UK Ltd|Banner Lane, Coventry, West Midlands|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,09/02/2022,08/02/2023,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

Award of a contract without prior publication of a call for competition on the UK e-notification service (within the meaning of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015)

•	Extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable for the contracting authority 
Explanation: 
In 2015 two new Cremators were supplied and installed in Weeley Crematorium by a company named ATI Environment UK Ltd, who were also responsible for the on-going maintenance.  The supplier went into receivership in March 2020, this left a number of local authorities including Tendring District Council with no service contract, and cremator equipment that had become increasingly unreliable and caught fire on one occasion.
The cremators were temporarily repaired in 2020 however, the current plant has now failed entirely, and an independent engineer's report dated October 2021 has confirmed that the plant cannot be returned to safe use, and both cremators are now unusable. Not only has this had a significant impact on the local community especially during the pandemic, but cremations are having to be undertaken at different venues in East Anglian, some distance from the local authority area. Tendring District Council is suffering a substantial loss of income.  
Service delivery, compliance and safety can only be achieved by the urgent replacement of the current cremators brought about by previous supplier failure and not by actions attributable to the authority.  The required timeline to run an open or restricted process would incur increased reliance on alternative venues outside of the local authority area, continued loss of income to the authority in addition to period for lead in and implementation of the contract.  Market insight has demonstrated that Facultative Technologies (FT) are a leading supplier in a very limited market and have a strong financial standing.  In addition, the soft market testing demonstrated FT to be cheaper than their main competitor with shorter lead times, minimizing disruption, with time being of the essence to return to a fully operational service for the benefit of the community and the public purse.",,,"East of England","42350000 ","Ian Taylor",itaylor@tendringdc.gov.uk,"Town Hall, Station Road",,CLACTON-ON-SEA,"CO15 1SE",England,"'+44 1255 686982",,,,,07/02/2022,30/09/2032,20/12/2021,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1539000,,07/02/2022,1539000,"[Facultatieve Technologies Limited|Moor Road
