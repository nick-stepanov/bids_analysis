Manchester Central is currently looking for suppliers to provide agency workers for a range of Event Hospitality Services across a number of City Centre locations.
At any one time, Manchester Central may require in excess of 350 workers. The agency staff may be provided by a number of suppliers.
Prior to commencement of work with Manchester Central all agency staff will be expected to undergo a Manchester Central site induction which covers site specific Health and Safety and operational matters which lasts no longer than 30 minutes. This will typically take the form of an induction video and is expected to be undertaken by the agency at their premises prior to staff being deployed on site.  For clarity induction time is not chargeable to the Company. MCCCL will reserve the right to audit twice yearly.
The Contract will be for a period of two (2) years from the commencement date of services with a Manchester Central only option to extend for a further period of twelve months. The contract value for 2 years is estimated at 1.4 million.
Manchester Central is committed to ensuring that all agency workers receive the National living wage and then the Real living wage once trained as an hourly rate of pay. As such the Company has fixed the rates that agency providers are required to pay to their staff (as a minimum rate of pay) and has hence fixed the rates it will pay agencies for the provision of services under this tender.  The proposed rates (being the current rates of pay and chargeable rates) are set out in Appendix 2 along with the mechanism for uplifting annually in line with increases to the National living wage and the Real Living wage. Untrained workers (see criteria for trained workers below) and trained workers must be paid the National Living wage or Real living wage irrespective of age and the chargeable rates for such untrained workers are also set out in Appendix 2 along with the future pricing mechanism. For clarity if the contract is extended the pricing mechanism shall continue as per the initial two years.
This tender is therefore quality and sustainability focused as prices payable are fixed.

There currently exists a misalignment between chemicals legislation and the goals of developing circular economy policies that risks significant uncertainty in the chemical safety and compliance of secondary materials, as well as locking contaminants into a circular economy.

As the UK further implements its own new and revised chemical regulatory regimes, understanding both the value of circular chemical resource use and preventing legacy chemical presence is a critical opportunity. An improved evidence base is needed to influence outcomes and investment under the Government's Resources and Waste Strategy and the development of a Chemicals Strategy for a Circular Economy.

This project is for a study to bring together available data and value of options in the management of the chemical content of waste and secondary materials. The report and data can support EA regulatory activities and strategic plans, including influencing the implementation of the Governments new chemical strategy. It can also provide a basis for better engagement with industry for investment on predictable outcomes from reuse, recycling and recovery, including decisions on the end of waste.""",,,"United Kingdom","73200000 ","Estelle Nma",Estelle.Nma@environment-agency.gov.uk,"Environment Agency (Trentside Offices)","Lady Bay Bridge","West Bridgford","NG2 5FA",England,,,"Award letter_Circular Economy Redacted.pdf ",,,16/09/2022,24/03/2023,25/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,32314,,16/09/2022,32314,"[Wood Group UK Ltd|Wsp House, 70 Chancery Lane, London, England, WC2A 1AF|COMPANIES_HOUSE|2190074|No|No]",,16/09/2022,24/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,17:00

A North West (NW) Allied Health Professionals survey (Annex 11) was conducted in January 2021 to understand how generalist and specialist AHP's are currently supporting cancer patients and to identify specific training needs. AHP's have a key role in delivering personalised care for patients however, the survey highlighted low awareness of personalised care assessments and interventions for cancer patients which needs to be addressed.

As part of the intelligence gathering for this specification, we consulted with individuals in AHP roles, their role in delivering care to people affected by cancer is not well defined or recognised and although they play a pivotal role in diagnosis, and personalised treatment, they remain an under-acknowledged part of the cancer workforce.

- A wide range of activity has taken place. It will be important to consult with a range of internal stakeholders to garner views.
- To fully reflect the two key KPIs that are relevant to the programme that have been added after the Theory of Change was completed.
- To consider how to reflect sustainability of partnerships within the Theory of Change.
- Update the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) elements in the Theory of Change. The Theory of Change addresses inclusion in broad terms. There is an overlay for gender, which needs to be updated. New overlays will need to be developed for anti-racism/decolonisation/equitable partnerships and disability to ensure the programme meets its commitment to embed/measure EDI as a core theme. The outcomes and indicators in the Monitoring framework should be updated accordingly.
- To include various new activities that have recently come into the programme, potentially broadening the scope of the programme.

We are not expecting a new Theory of Change. The focus must be on updating and refining existing logic sequences.

      The intended use for these monitors is in fixed occupied locations outside the primary shielding. In these locations, radiation is heavily attenuated by the accelerator components and shielding structures. The shielding has been designed such that dose rates external to the shield walls of the accelerator should be below 1 µSv/h, however, unexpected beam losses can occur which could lead to unplanned, elevated dose rates above the design criteria outside the enclosure. The purpose of these monitors is to detect dose rates at systematically selected locations around the accelerator and either warn those in the vicinity or terminate power to the accelerator depending on the magnitude of the detected dose rate.",,,"Any region","38341600 ","Sarah Grant",sarah.grant@ukri.org,"Polaris House","North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FL",UK,07394401259,,,"https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=732530400 ","Procurement Contract Transparency Data: Redacted contract documents will be made available within the next 30 days on the UKRI website at: https://www.ukri.org/about-us/procurement-contract-transparency-data/",16/09/2022,31/03/2023,15/09/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Products,72047.04,,15/09/2022,72047.04,"[Berthold Technologies (UK) Ltd|6 Allied Business Centre

This will include providing support to families to support their children and young people. 
      
      The focus of the new model is to develop a flexible support offer providing accessible and timely response to the emotional well-being needs of children and young people, embedding the offer within the heart of Coventry's communities, supporting those harder to reach groups, particularly those who find the more clinical setting overwhelming and off-putting. 
      
      The model has been shaped and developed, following the completion of an in-depth needs analysis, including stakeholder engagement and up-to-date policy review. In addition, the impact of covid on the mental health of children and young people, as well as the overall CAMHS system has informed the design of the service model. 
      
      Engagement and policy review outlined that children and young people, and their carers feel most unsafe and unsupported when sitting on long waiting lists, with no contact or information in the interim. The new service aims to bridge that gap. Providing early intervention, effective signposting, referral, and where possible social prescribing, this is a new service that will hold children and their families safely whilst they wait for further intervention and support. A service that aims to prevent escalation of need by intervening early, providing low-level support and therapeutic intervention which can be accessed not only by the child but by the family as a whole.

Approximately 250 wafers remain to be tested over the course of the next year.  The maximum throughput of this system is approximately two wafers per day, and this requires working times to be staggered such that one wafer may be loaded in the morning, and one in the early evening.

      The BFI and its strategic partners are responsible for the preservation and accessibility of a significant share of the UK's film heritage. The film collections encompass the entire history of film production and include examples of an extremely wide range of formats and systems, which are being copied onto modern digital media as part of our mass migration strategy. The BFI also currently has a responsibility to record and archive sixteen channels of UK television output. The BFI, therefore, has an ongoing requirement for certified data tape stock and it wishes to establish a four-year framework agreement with a reseller or a number of resellers to fulfil that requirement.
      
      The BFI's Digital Preservation Infrastructure has a dual data library system, which incorporates separate, automated LTO (Linear Tape Open) and IBM TS (Tape Storage) data tape robots. Therefore, both LTO and IBM sets of stock are required to provide secure and resilient long-term data preservation.
      
      Spectra-certified stock is required to fulfil the performance and quality criteria essential to the very stringent requirements of the BFI National Archive digital preservation system.
      
      Current BFI's requirements are:
      
      o LTO-8 (aiming to move to LTO-9 within the next year); and
      o IBM 3592 JE.
      
      The framework agreement is envisaged to be with a number of suppliers and the duration is four years. The estimated value for the duration of the agreement is up to ?450,000.
      
      Full details are set out in the ITT.

It is a high performing ALMO with aspirations to be the best and deliver outstanding services to each and every resident. SHP prides itself on the close working relationships with residents that it is developing, delivering over 1,300 reactive repairs each month.
In 2019, the board at SHP took the decision to deliver repairs in house and took the first steps in April 2020 by ending the contract with its current provider, and setting up a repairs team to undertake reactive repairs services to residents.
A previous procurement exercise for minor and major works contractors has been completed and this is the final procurement to establish a panel for a contractor to deliver reactive repairs on door entry and other security systems to support the in-house team.

MoJ has been asked to provide potential ways to meet these goals by March 2024 with any proposals needing to be signed by senior MoJ stakeholders in September. The Initiative was brought in by the Government to modernise and increase efficiency of the Civil Service and creating a more stable, diverse, agile and resilient workforce will have wide ranging benefits including acting as an enabler to wider reform (workforce, regime, digital and high reliability organisation).
The Prime Minister and Cabinet are seeking to improve the efficiency of the Civil Service workforce back to 2016 numbers over the next three years, meaning a reduction of around 91,000 roles.
In May 2022, the Prime Minister and Cabinet tasked all ministerial departments with bringing the Civil Service workforce back to 2016 numbers over the next three years, meaning a reduction of around 91,000 roles. There was an increased growth of civil servants to meet the demands of managing Brexit and the Covid pandemic and as of the end of March 2022, there were 479,040 full-time equivalent (FTE) civil servants.
By 2025, the Government aim for the Civil Service is we will be leaner; but we will be more agile, more capable and better equipped to serve the country and respond to the challenges of the mid-21st century.

Mechanical and hand demolition is the preferred methodology for this project. 199 Dudley Road is to be split by hand and party wall accommodation works undertaken to 197 Dudley Road.  The site must be well secured by use of appropriate fencing during and at the end of the contract.
      
      The Contract will be for a duration of 5 weeks (unless terminated under the terms and conditions of contract). 
      
      The contract will be awarded to a single supplier.
      
      The contract will be let using a JCT Minor Works Form of Contract 2016, issued by the Joint Contracts Tribunal with Birmingham City Council amendments.
      
      It is anticipated the works will commence in September 2022 and be completed by October 2022.

We envisaged that this project would track batches of broilers as they progress through the different stages in the slaughterhouse and cutting plant. It is anticipated that sampling would be taken at key points in the slaughter and cutting process from whole incoming bird to finished whole or portioned chicken, as well as environmental swabs of the associated areas. The samples should include broilers and its components as well as caeca to see if there are changes in the AMR profile during the process. It is important to consider the impact of successive flocks on the subsequent contamination of the broilers, so sampling should consider inclusion of batches immediately before and after cleaning cycles. We expect the bacteria to be tested for should include at least E. coli and Campylobacter.

We expect the final report to include a full analysis of the AMR findings, with a focus on the transmission of AMR during the processing of broiler carcases, to see if there are key areas that may require further investigation or intervention to reduce the spread of AMR bacteria.",,,"Any region","73000000 73100000 73300000 ",,fsa.commercial@food.gov.uk,"Foss House, Peasholme Green",,York,"YO1 7PR",England,,,,"https://food.bravosolution.co.uk ",,15/09/2022,29/02/2024,24/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,310705,,15/09/2022,310705,"[University of Lincoln|National Centre for Food Manufacturing, Holbeach, Lincolnshire, PE12 7PT, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,15/09/2022,29/02/2024,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

NICE is looking for an academic partner (or joint bid, or consortium) to work on the delivery of an NHSx AI Lab commissioned project to develop NICE's Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies to fully incorporate data driven technologies that incorporate artificial intelligence, including those that use adaptive algorithms.  The Framework will describe an approach to the classification of AI technologies that triages technologies for health technology evaluation and will describe the levels and types of clinical evidence that should be available, or developed, for these technologies to demonstrate their clinical and economic value in the UK health and care system. This includes evidence of clinical effectiveness relevant to the intended use(s) of the technology. 

The standards framework will be used to support innovators and technology developers, including commercial organisations, of appropriate evidence-generation plans; research funders and investors who are considering funding the development of data driven technologies as well as evaluators and commissioners. 

To support this work NICE is looking for an academic partner with
experience of developing:

•	risk-based approaches to the classification of technologies that incorporate artificial intelligence for use in health care settings 
•	methods for the evaluation of data driven technologies (including those that incorporate artificial intelligence) in terms of their clinical effectiveness and value

      Sandwell Metropolitan Borough ""The Council"" requires Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE) training to be delivered face to face to Housing Management employees. 
      
      Approximately 80 employees require training with a maximum of 15 delegates attending each cohort.  This figure will likely change due to business demand or higher priority projects taking precedence.  Training must be delivered in a classroom at a Sandwell MBC venue but with a virtual option if required by the business.
      
      Background
      Many Sandwell residents are often vulnerable and socially excluded for reasons such as adversity or trauma because of complex psychological and emotional needs, resulting in difficulties engaging with Sandwell services. Although primarily PIE has focused more on the homelessness sector, Sandwell MBC would prefer a more broader approach to training, covering all areas within housing such as Housing Officers, Anti-Social Behaviour and Community Safety.
      
      The estimated budget available for the delivery of this training is £20,000 and the contract period will be for 1 year, commencing 1 September 2022 to 31 August 2022, with training to start as soon as possible from the contract start date.  However, this information is intended to assist with the preparation of your bid. The Council does not bind itself to this or any other figure and is not a guarantee of business which may be generated from this contract.
      
      The contract value shall remain fixed for the duration of the contract.
      
      The Council will be using the In-tend e-Tendering System for this Procurement exercise, please visit https://in-tendhost.co.uk/sandwellmbc to access the Sandwell MBC In-tend Supplier Portal.
      
      From here you will be able to register your company, express an interest in the opportunity, and gain immediate access to Quotation or other related documents.

(OPE) There is currently an underspend within the Devon and Torbay One Public Estate Partnership which is planned to be reallocated to Devon Office Hubs Phase 2.

Devon Office Hubs project looks to rationalise use of the public sector estate by exploring opportunities for colocation of public sector services and partnership working. With the national shift towards hybrid working, the need for office space has reduced, so effective usage of the current provision would allow public sector organisations to release or repurpose excess space. 

Devon Office Hubs Phase 1, which was produced by Placemaking as the tendered consultants, produced a series of recommendations and next steps for the second phase of the project. These form the basis of the specification for Phase 2. This includes zeroing in on the four identified opportunities for Office Hubs - Exeter, Tiverton, Barnstaple, and Newton Abbot - to create roadmaps for how each of those projects would come forward. Those roadmaps will include consideration of the individual challenges of each hub, the financing required and how this would be sourced, created a project plan including timescales and risk assessments, and calculating the benefits of each hub.

This work is in response to the Transport Select Committee's Third Report of Session 2021-22, published following its inquiry into the rollout and safety of smart motorways. The aims of the review are split into the following two stages.

For the avoidance of doubt, this work order is for Stage 1 of the review process only.

1.	Stage 1 - Assess whether the current health and safety governance processes and regulatory framework for implementing changes to the design and operation of the SRN are sufficiently robust (for both the present and with future consideration), or if improvements should be made. Any upcoming changes to governance/regulatory processes should also be captured in this assessment. The assessment will be informed by a comparison with the governance processes and regulatory framework within comparable sectors such as rail and aviation.
2.	Stage 2 - Evaluate different approaches through which the improvements to health and safety governance identified in Stage 1 of the review process could be made. This will include: 
-	assessing the case (costs, benefits, barriers, and risks) for expanding the role of the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) to undertake formal health and safety assessments.
-	identifying and assessing the case for other approaches to achieve desired outcomes.   

The analysis should consider future changes in the design and operation of the SRN (for example the digital roads agenda) to help future proof the assessment of health and safety governance processes. DfT officials will discuss this requirement with the Supplier at project inception to confirm the scope and approach taken in the analysis.

Progression to Stage 2 of the project will be subject to the outcomes of Stage 1. DfT will review the Stage 1 findings and decide whether to progress to Stage 2.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,SPaTS2@nationalhighways.co.uk,"The Cube",,Birmingham,"B1 1RN",England,,,"T0354 TRAP3001 SPaTS 2 DfT Award Letter - AJJV - trans.docx ",,,13/09/2022,31/01/2023,19/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,125256.82,,12/09/2022,125256.82,[AJJV|LONDON|NONE_OTHER||No|No],,13/09/2022,31/01/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,19:00
