PS/21/114,Contract,"DRIVER & VEHICLE LICENSING AGENCY",Awarded,2022-01-26T11:22:20Z,"Provision of Building Surveying and Mechanical & Electrical Advice","2.1	The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (""DVLA"" or the ""Authority"") is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport, based at 3 sites in the Swansea region, employing around 6,500 staff. The Agency's primary aims are to facilitate road safety and general law enforcement by maintaining accurate registers of drivers and vehicle keepers, and to collect Vehicle Excise Duty. 

2.2	In March 2005 DVLA entered a 20-year PFI contract with Telereal Trillium (TT) for the refurbishment of the estate and the provision of facilities management (""FM""). DVLA and TT have agreed that DVLA has the option to de-scope the Soft Services element from the contract from 31st March 2023 (""partial Termination"").  The contract expires on 31st March 2025.  

2.3	A Facilities Management (FM) Futures programme was formed in 2019 within which the PFI Contract Expiry Team has the remit to deliver an effective contract expiry and transition from the current PFI contract.  The team comprises DVLA Estates Management, Commercial and 'project' personnel.  A business case was approved by the DVLA Executive team in January 2021 that supported procurement of technical advice to the programme.

2.4	The PFI contract expiry requires that all assets are returned to DVLA in good condition.  The expiry also means that it will be necessary to transition to a different operating model for the delivery of all FM services.  It is with both of these challenges that DVLA requires 'project' leadership and specialist technical advice to 

i.	Confirm the scope of assets to be returned and the efficacy of the asset register. 
ii.	Work with the results of a recent comprehensive asset condition survey.
iii.	Manage a 'survey on expiry' with commercial advisers in ensuring that the assets are returned in the requisite condition; and
iv.	To support the design of a new FM service delivery model and its implementation.

2.5	It is anticipated that project leadership/technical advice will be required in relation to projects related to the key asset types: - 

i.	Land & Buildings - Chartered Building Surveyor or applicable 
ii.	Plant & Equipment - Chartered Mechanical or Electrical Engineer or applicable

This award notice relates to grant funding to support the start-up, development or diversification costs of new flexi-job apprenticeship agencies, or existing Apprenticeship Training Agencies (ATAs) who wish to become a flexi-job apprenticeship agency.

Funding will:
- support the start-up, development or diversification of flexi-job apprenticeship agencies allowing employers of all sizes to benefit from high-quality apprenticeships that are relevant and responsive to their skills needs and economic priorities.
- allow organisations to overcome barriers to the use of apprenticeships in their sectors caused by non-traditional and project-based employment models.
- increase starts in sectors where non-traditional and project-based employment models have made it harder for employers to engage with apprenticeships.
- drive quality experiences for apprentices, with corresponding improved achievement rates, resulting in positive outcomes for apprentices in terms of onward destinations in employment and training.
- support the progression of apprentices into sustainable employment or self-employment (mirroring the norm for their sector or profession)",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and The Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West","80000000 ",,esfaprocurement.help@education.gov.uk,"Education and Skills Funding Agency, Cheylesmore House South, Quinton Road",,Coventry,"CV1 2WT",England,,,,,,24/01/2022,31/03/2023,07/10/2021,YES,tender_280564/986270,Yes,Yes,No,Services,4993057.82,,24/01/2022,4993057.82,"[British Broadcasting Corporation|Broadcasting House, Portland Place Marylebone,  London, W1A 1AA|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Calico Enterprise Limited|Centenary Court, Croft Street,  Burnley,  Lancashire,  BB11 2ED|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Evolve Apprentices Ltd|1 Waterside Station Road,  Harpenden, AL5 4US|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Future Nation|55 Colmore Row, Birmingham, England, B3 2AA|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Inspire ATA Limited|Unit 4 Berghem Mews Blythe Road London W14 0HN|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Management Development Services Ltd|14 Papyrus Business Park Werrington Peterborough PE4 5BH|NONE_OTHER||No|No][McGinley Support Services (Infrastructure) Limited|200 Strand, London, England, WC2R 1DJ|NONE_OTHER||No|No][ScreenSkills Limited|94 Euston Street, London, England, NW1 2HA|NONE_OTHER||No|No][The Mid Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry Limited|Unit 3 First Floor,  Pennine Business Park Longbow Close,  Bradley, Huddersfield, HD2 1GQ|NONE_OTHER||No|No][The NHS North of England Commissioning Unit|John Snow House,  Durham,  DH1 3YG|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Training and Apprenticeships in Construction Limited|Building 262 B Lamas Road Badersfield, Norwich Norfolk, England NR10 5FB|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,24/01/2022,31/03/2023,"Other Competed Grant",,12:00

This funding is to support nature-based solutions such as woodland creation and peatland restoration, as part of an array of actions needed to reach the UK government target of net zero carbon by 2050.

As part of the Nature for Climate programme, the England's Community Forests (ECF) network, led by The Mersey Forest and supported by the Community Forest Trust, has been tasked by DEFRA with putting together a 6,000+ hectare programme of new woodland creation, called 'Trees for Climate' (T4C), to be delivered over the period 2020 to 2025.

Greenwood Community Forest, part of Nottinghamshire County Council (NCC) will lead on the T4C programme in Nottinghamshire. As part of the indicative pipeline of projects for the programme, Greenwood has indicated that it would be able to facilitate the establishment of 250ha of new woodland, with both direct delivery of schemes and working through partner organisations.

For Year 2 (2021/22) of T4C, Greenwood is intending on planting 3 sites, two owned by Nottinghamshire County Council and one owned by Newark and Sherwood District Council of which is the subject of this tender and is shown in Appendix 1 - Year 2 T4C Planting Site 1:

The Site is former colliery pit tip, restored to a mix of woodland and low-grade agricultural grassland. The planting scheme will take place on the grassland areas, which are undulating in topography with some steep slopes, vehicle wheeling ruts and poorly drained areas. It should be noted the Site suffers from unauthorised off-road usage (4x4s and trail bikes).

The scheme has been designed to comply with the UK Forestry Standard, and to deliver native broad-leaved woodland and various associated outputs including carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water quality and public access.

In order to maximise the chances of being able to undertake the planting work this planting season, we are now seeking to appoint a Planting Contractor with the relevant skills and experience, and the ability to deliver within the specified timeframe.",,,"East Midlands","03000000 45112700 ","Jamie Burton",jamie.burton2@nottscc.gov.uk,"County Hall","Loughborough Road Westbridgford",Nottinghamshire,"NG2 7QP","United Kingdom","'+44 1159774504",http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=fa9cf2f3-f451-ec11-810e-005056b64545 ",,28/01/2022,31/03/2024,07/01/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,405000,405000,24/01/2022,493720,"[Dobson UK|Old Hagg Farm, Doddington, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, LN6 4RY|NONE||Yes|No][Lineside Structure Maintenance Limited|Works Depot Lilac grove, Beeston, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, NG9 1PF|NONE||Yes|No][Thomson Habitats|Compass House, Surrey Research Park, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7AG|NONE||Yes|No]",,28/01/2022,31/03/2024,"Open ",,12:00

The options may be delivered by a range of providers to support people who have been unable to successfully achieve abstinence and recover in the community and where there is rationale to support the need to access treatment in a specialist facility.
      
      This procurement is for services listed within schedule 3 of The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and as a result are subject to the Light Touch Regime under those regulations.

Any new entrants will be required to meet the original tender requirements before being appointed to the Framework. Existing Providers would be invited to re-submit their tender response should they wish to do so.

It is becoming established practice for government bodies to work closely together and share contract opportunities.

We all want to make our air purer, our water cleaner, our land greener and our food more sustainable. We want to restore and enhance the environment for the next generation, leaving it in a better state than we found it.  A key part of the success of these ambitions will be how we tackle waste. In 2017 Defra published its 25 Year Environment Plan which is a plan of action. It commits us to using resources efficiently and to keep them in use for longer to minimise waste and reduce its environmental impacts by promoting reuse and recycling.  We will work towards eliminating all avoidable waste by 2050 and all avoidable plastic waste over the lifetime of the 25 Year Environment Plan. In 2019, the UK became the first major nation to legislate for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means that the government must shape policies and regulations that influence the transition of the whole economy towards net zero. Reducing electronic waste can help to cut carbon emissions. The rise in purchases of electronic goods is a significant driver of emissions globally. By 2040 and on current trends, it is estimated that worldwide emissions from the production and use of electronics could rise to a level exceeding half that associated with the global transportation sector today.
The Resources and Waste Strategy for England published in 2018, adds detail the actions outlined in the 25 Year Environment Plan.  It includes a commitment for the government to work with the devolved nations to consult on changing the waste electrical and electronic (WEEE) and batteries producer responsibility regimes to incentivise more sustainable design, increase recycling and ensure alignment with a common framework. The proposals are part of an ambitious, co-ordinated programme of waste reform which places the principle of producer responsibility at its heart.",,,London,"73210000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Anthesis 35036 Contract - Short Form - REDACTED_Redacted.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,26/01/2022,29/04/2022,11/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,24/01/2022,66912,"[Anthesis UK Ltd|Unit J, Taper Studios, 175 Long Lane, Bermondsey, London, SE1 4GT, United Kingdom|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,26/01/2022,29/04/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

The Internationalisation Learning Cohorts model is a new activity which forms part of the British Council's Going Global Partnerships Programme. The learning cohorts enable the British Council to convene UK and overseas experts and strengthen internationalisation through bringing together an interested cohort of Higher Education Institution (HEI) leaders, senior managers, policymakers to have a sustained dialogue over a relevant theme. This is to enable virtual networking around some significant content of mutual interest, tackling issues together (e.g Internationalisation of higher education; understanding transnational education, innovative approaches to TNE). The cohort structure is adaptable to the desired learning outcomes of each cohort and scalable for future iterations. The initial, proposed format is for a cohort to meet for a 1.5-2 hour discussion every two weeks for a total of four sessions.

Each session will be led by an experienced online facilitator and will feature a relevant thought piece from an expert, followed by a discussion. Every cohort, through its discussions, activities and knowledge-sharing, will make a knowledge contribution to the wider cohort network and will build up a bank of experience and good practice in internationalisation, shared online.

To address this requirement, the British Council is seeking a learning facilitator with experience in course design and delivery to create and disseminate online content and training in international higher education. The successful applicant will use sector knowledge to identify and collaborate with experts in various thematic areas and deliver an initial series of pilot learning cohorts for representatives from higher education institutions throughout the world.",,,"United Kingdom","73200000 80000000 ",,uk.procurement@britishcouncil.org,"1 Redman Place",,LONDON,E201JQ,England,,,,,"Bidders will be required to register on British Council`s e-Tendering portal In-Tend hosted at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/britishcouncil

The Hertfordshire and West Essex ICS are working to improve Ophthalmology services across primary, community and secondary care.  This is in order to respond to an ever-increasing demand for secondary care services.  The demand is predicted to rise as a result of earlier diagnosis for chronic conditions, new treatments, increasing population changes and the damaging impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.

Eye care services have traditionally been a hospital-based speciality, however, with the development of advanced equipment and education, many ophthalmic assessments and treatments can be carried out effectively in primary care settings.  

On 22nd November 2021 West Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (as the host CCG on behalf of the Herts and West Essex ICS) published a call-off tender using the national Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for Electronic Eyecare Referral Systems which was established in January 2021.  Following a compliant procurement process the contract has been awarded to Nonmedical Limited trading as Cinapsis.

The initial contract is for a pilot which will be delivered across the East and North Hertfordshire CCG area, should this pilot be successful the service will be extended across Herts Valleys CCG and West Essex CCG areas.  The contract will be for a period of 12 months with the option to extend for a further 12 months (1st April 2022 to 31st March 2023 with the option to extend from 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024).

The contract value is for the 2 year period and may increase should the service be extended to other commissioning organisations across the HWE ICS up to a maximum of £147,000.",,"CM16 6TN","East of England","48180000 ",,sarah.beaumont@attain.co.uk,"Building 4 Spencer Close, St Margaret&apos;s Hospital, The Plain",,Epping,"CM16 6TN",England,,https://westessexccg.nhs.uk,,,,01/04/2022,31/03/2023,10/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,70000,,24/01/2022,70000,"[Nonmedical Limited trading as Cinapsis|Red House, Cemetery Pales, Brookwood, Woking, Surrey, GU24 0BL|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,01/04/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,12:00

The Agency's primary aims are to facilitate road safety and general law enforcement by maintaining accurate registers of drivers and vehicle keepers, and to collect Vehicle Excise Duty. 

2.2	In March 2005 DVLA entered a 20-year PFI contract with Telereal Trillium (TT) for the refurbishment of the estate and the provision of facilities management (""FM"") services.  DVLA and TT have agreed that DVLA has the option to de-scope the Soft Services element from the contract from 31st March 2023 (partial Termination). The contract expires on 31st March 2025.  

2.3	A FM Futures programme was formed in 2019 within which the PFI Contract Expiry Team has the remit to deliver an effective contract expiry and transition from the current PFI contract. The team comprises DVLA Estates Management, Contract Expiry & Commercial and Project management personnel.  A business case was approved by the DVLA Executive team in January 2021 that supported procurement of specialist advice to the programme.

2.4	The PFI contract expiry requires that all assets are returned to DVLA in good condition.  The expiry also means that it will be necessary to transition to a different operating model for the delivery of all FM services.  It is with both of these challenges that DVLA requires PFI Contract Expiry specialist to provide contract/commercial perspective input to managing

I.	Supplier compliance to contract expiry
II.	the scope of assets to be returned and the efficacy of the asset register 
III.	handling of the results of a recent comprehensive asset condition survey
IV.	a 'survey on expiry' with technical advisers in ensuring that the assets are returned in the requisite condition.

This wellbeing model builds on the assets of residents and people in the local community to create a home for life for residents, providing care in line with the principles of ""just enough support"" to enable them to live the best lives they can, deferring or avoiding the need for hospital admissions or a move to more traditional residential care settings.  

Caring and compassionate support is provided by local ethical care providers who are passionate and dedicated to working in an asset-based way ensuring individuals live the life they choose and can fulfil their aims and ambitions.

The events should be face-to-face seminar, talks or workshops that should target coastal communities relying on fisheries or stakeholders (harbours, vessel crews) related to the fishery industry.

Outreach material (presentations, brochures) are required to be prepared in English, Tamil and Sinhala and will be used during the events. Cefas will provide some initial outreach material that can be used during the events or can be used to produce new material. Where possible and appropriate, these materials (e.g. slides) will be adapted to the target audience. The events should be planned with the aim to cover as many different communities around Sri Lanka as possible. Before starting the events, the materials will have to be cleared by Cefas.
