This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the Crown Commercial Services Research and Insights DPS - RM6126


Brief Description of Requirement

We are commissioning a desk-based policy development project to further scope and consider the feasibility of the 'local markets' option that is being considered as part of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) programme. 

REMA's core objective is to reform GB electricity market arrangements so that they facilitate the full decarbonisation of the electricity system by 2035, subject to security of supply, and are cost effective for consumers. It will do this by looking at various elements of the electricity market arrangements, including the wholesale market, capacity adequacy, low carbon investment, flexibility, and system operability, and by implementing reforms in each of those areas to ensure that our future market arrangements will:

-	deliver a step change in the rate of deployment of low carbon technologies and reduce our dependence on hydrocarbon imports;
-	provide the right signals for flexibility across the system;
-	facilitate consumers to take greater control of their electricity use by rewarding them through improved price signals whilst ensuring fair outcomes;
-	optimise assets operating at local, regional, and national levels; and
-	ensure that the security of the system can be maintained at all times.

This commission will support the development of one of the more transformative potential reforms to current wholesale market arrangements, specifically, models which can introduce and strengthen locational price signals at the local level through the development of 'local markets'.",,,"Any region","79310000 ",,nicola.turner@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,,,,17/10/2022,23/12/2022,04/10/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,60000,,07/10/2022,60000,"[CEPA LLP|Queens House, 55-56 Lincoln&apos;s Inn Fields, London, Greater London, WC2A 3LJ, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,17/10/2022,23/12/2022,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,11:00

They have a need for different routes to source candidates, whether that be temporary workers or permanent, with the supplier able to advise or lead on such things as targeted recruitment, on-payroll recruitment, vacancy advertising, talent transfer, and temporary to permanent opportunities.

Semantics and a lesson learned regarding the use of the CCS framework that the main contract was called off, has led to the need to add a bespoke contract under this agreement - we can`t use the CCS framework to access this supplier for those services but we can use the YPO framework to compliantly direct Award to Hays.
This approach will ensure that we comply with regulations, the scope of each framework and also ensure that we deliver the strategy and contracts that DDTS approved.

      Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council invites tenders for the provision of a Wrap Around Service. 
      
      The Council has committed with its health partners to provide a short-term Wrap Around Service to people who require care in their own home. This commitment is to ensure that people in the community are supported in their own homes to remain independent or to support a person being discharged from hospital who may need reablement support whilst longer term arrangements are being established. The principle of the service is to ensure people's independence is maximised and individuals are not formally entered into the care and support system unnecessarily.
      
      The aim of the service is to promote a Home First ethos and support individuals to remain in their own homes by providing Care Workers at short notice, and within an hour of contact, to step in and prevent community crisis, and provide care and support to enable an assessment of an individual's needs, for up to 72 hours. This may include offering day and/or night sits to support a person for up to 72 hours.  The Wrap Around Service will enable people with or without assessed needs under the Care Act to have access to a short-term provision (up to 72 hours) to support them to continue to live independently in the community or prevent a hospital admission whilst longer term needs are being assessed.  
      
      Organisations with the capability to provide a service at short notice, and within an hour of contact, for extended periods where day or night sits may be required, are invited to tender.
      
      The 2-year total cost is estimated to be £347,040 subject to referrals being received that match predictions and any potential uplift in care costs.
      
      The Council will be using the In-tend e-Tendering System for this Procurement exercise, please visit https://in-tendhost.co.uk/sandwellmbc to access the Sandwell MBC In-tend Supplier Portal.

This service will commence on 1st April 2023 following a mobilisation period (inclusive of TUPE transfer).
The service will deliver a range of interventions, including providing a wider prevention and education offer to other professionals, support to families and input to other local delivery agendas. The service will cover advice, treatment and recovery and will be available to all Rotherham residents who require support with substance misuse including problems with prescribed and over the counter medication.
The service specification provides a framework which will contribute to the outcomes and objectives the Council wishes to achieve through the commissioning of the service, aligned to the Health and Wellbeing Strategy.
One service provider will be appointed to deliver the Service through a single contract.
The Service Provider is encouraged to demonstrate innovation and added value in their service design.
It is anticipated that the contract will commence on 1st April 2023 and will run for a period of five years making the expiry date 31st March 2028. The contract will have an option to extend by a further five years in any number or combination of extensions at the sole discretion of the Council, making the latest possible expiry date 31st March 2033.
Bidders are advised that the maximum budget available for the core provision of this contract over the initial 5-year term (set and fixed for all suppliers) is £16,115,000 equating to £3,223,000 per annum. All values stated are exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT). Any bids that fall outside this budget will be rejected.
As the contract has the potential for a further five-year extension, the total overall budget for the full 10 years of the contract will equate to £32,230,000, this will account for the core contract activity only.
The service will be subject to core and non-core contract activities.
As a result, the service may be subject to future additional funding sources throughout the lifetime of the contract, this non-core activity will be linked to any service or provision that meets the needs of or provide outcomes for advice, treatment, and recovery services suitable for Rotherham residents of all ages who are experiencing problems with substance misuse. The non-core requirements as they arise will be subject to negotiation and agreement with the successful provider. The non-core activity will form part of a framework contract for additional services which the Council may place orders for from time to time subject to additional funding.
There is no commitment from the Council that any orders will be placed for non-core activity as a result of additional funding that is secured.

Protected Site Strategies are an important element of the Government's ambition to deliver a better Environment within a generation, as set out in the 25 Year Environment Plan (25YEP). They are a statutory power in the Environment Act 2021 for Natural England (NE) to bring together key stakeholders to make long-term collaborative commitments that address impacts on the species, habitats and geophysical interest of Protected Sites. To test the full potential for PSS mechanisms and inform the statutory guidance for PSS, NE are running five local pilots from mid-2022.There will be a requirement to refine the overarching Theory of Change (ToC) for the project and, in addition each pilot will require the formation of a bespoke ToC and development of an evaluation framework. The pilot themes to be investigated can be summarised as: Overcoming community concerns over tree felling and re-wetting of bogs; supporting planning authorities with limited ecological resources to realise the value of protected sites; setting the framework for farmers to transition to low pollution farm systems; putting the economic case for reducing pollution to land-based enterprises; management of deer to improve woodland health and deer health.  In concert with this evaluation of impact and process, each pilot requires rapid desk reviews and social science insights in order to ensure social aspects are appropriately incorporated into the evaluations, and to inform and learn from the implementation of pilots so as to maximise their effectiveness in relation to stakeholder engagement. This may include the development and testing of social indicators. The resulting social science insights will be included and expanded upon in PSS advisory toolkits. It is also likely to involve stakeholder mapping exercises. 

In Phase 1 (by March 2023), Natural England is looking for a supplier to develop Theories of Change and Evaluation Frameworks for each of five local PSS pilots and for the overarching project. It is anticipated that each of the frameworks will look at shorter-term process and longer-term impact evaluations as well as explore value for money. The contractors will also inform the evaluation frameworks through deep dive case studies for the pilots and key cross-cutting themes - we anticipate this requiring 50% of contract time.

Phase 2 will involve delivery of the evaluation for each of the pilots and identification or testing of key levers to secure commitments from stakeholders. We anticipate Phase 2 requiring 50% of contract effort by March 2024.

Depending on project needs and context there may be a further option to extend and expand the contract to cover a 12-month period of monitoring, data collection and evaluation for each of the five pilots. This will require a similar amount of contractor effort to each of the previous phases.",,"SW1P 3JR","Any region","03000000 ",,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"Nobel House, 17 Smith Square",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,http://defra.bravosolutions.co.uk,"ecm_66237 - Appendix 2 - Order Form - PSS Evaluation of Impact and Process contract with Natural England_Redacted.pdf ",,,04/11/2022,09/10/2025,29/08/2022,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,711700,,10/10/2022,711700,"[ICF Consulting Services|Riverscape, 10 Queen Street Place.

TNA467,Contract,"THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES",Awarded,2022-10-27T11:06:45+01:00,"Works Contract - National Archives Learning Centre","The National Archives is undertaking a Public Space Programme, redeveloping the public spaces of Q1, its 1977 brutalist concrete archive building in Kew, London. The works being tendered will form a new broadcast studio and supporting spaces on the first floor of Q1 to create a world leading digital learning and production space. 
 
The broadcast space and two supporting production studios are to be acoustically separated from the surrounding space with new glazed and solid partitions and attenuation of services. The existing ceilings are to be removed and replaced with the diversion, rationalisation and adaption of existing services. The spaces will require adaption of the existing VAV air conditioning system and additional cooling, with new AV, lighting and power. New linings and soft furnishings will support room acoustics. Existing floor finishes are to be replaced, and new bespoke and proprietary joinery fitted. 
 
The adjacent circulation space will form an informal study area with new ceilings, floor finishes and joinery. The works include the conversion of an existing study space into a handwashing and locker area with new drainage, domestic water services, extract ventilation, sanitary ware, joinery, floor and ceiling finishes. 
 
The works include mechanical and electrical enabling works to allow for the construction of an adjacent learning space at a future date.

The works are within the public areas of the National Archives. The building is open to the public 9am-5pm, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, 9am-7pm Tuesday and Thursday, and 11am - 4pm for the first Sunday of each month. The building must remain operational throughout the works. The works area will need to be carefully hoarded to protect adjacent areas from dust and noise. Noisy works that would disrupt nearby reading areas will need to be carried out outside of public opening hours.

Estimated Value of Works:
£900,000 + VAT

Timetable:
We aim to award the contract w/c 16th August 2022. 
Mobilisation and Construction should be completed by w/c 13th February 2023.

This will be a restricted procurement, with the five top ranked bidders  being invited to participate in the invitation to tender process.  Those bidders will be selected using the criteria specified in the attached documentation.

The University of Chester needed to ensure it is compliant with legislation and most importantly had assurance on the continual and reliable operation of its equipment, for the protection of its staff, students, tenants and other personnel.   The University therefore required Service Providers to supply the following maintenance services for its Fire Alarm Systems and Fire Extinguishers, in 2 Tender Lots (as detailed below): 

•	Proactive Planned Maintenance Service Visit services -  proactive planned inspection, testing and maintenance (Lot 1 and Lot 2)
•	Minor Repair or Replacement - services undertaken at the time of but in addition to the Proactive Planned Maintenance Service Visit services (Lot 1 and Lot 2)
•	Emergency Reactive Response - 24/7/365 emergency call outs for fault diagnosis and repair of Fire Alarm Systems (Lot 1 only)

The University was seeking to award contracts for the co-ordination, management, administration and completion of these works for a period of 3 years, with a review after each year and an option to extend for a further 2 periods of 12 months. 
Tenderers should note that not all systems / items of equipment would need a Proactive Planned Maintenance Service Visit immediately at the start of the contract, so it may be some months before works would commence.  A schedule of works was set out in the documents: 

o	Document 2.2 - Pricing Schedule, Asset Register & SOR - LOT 1 - Fire Alarm
o	Document 2.3 - Pricing Schedule, Asset Register & SOR - LOT 2 - Fire Extinguishers

The range of fire systems / items of equipment was divided into two lots and tenderers were invited to bid for one or both lots.  

The procurement documents were available for unrestricted and full direct access, free of charge, at: https://in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofchester. 

This opportunity was also been published on Find a Tender Service.

Please note the values in this award notice are rounded up.

It is proposed that training should cascade key public health information out to the community on the learning of key skills. Providers will be required to provide courses to help:  
      
      o Deepen understanding of community organising 
      o Develop core community organising leadership skills such as 1-2-1 relational meetings, storytelling, power analysis, campaign strategy, action-planning and negotiation skills;
      o Equip people to lead change in their community
      
      Community leaders should be able help to provide regular messaging and updates regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, if necessary. Leaders will be trained to increase or improve existing activities to work with residents who are most at risk of COVID-19 - helping to build trust and empower at-risk groups to protect themselves and their families. Specifically relating to COVID-19, the leadership training will help community leaders to: 
      
      o Increase capability to interact and communicate information and guidance from Government and local authorities that is accessible to diverse communities, who may be harder to reach or receiving misinformation, facilitating the following of safer behaviours and making of informed choices.
      o Build stronger relationships and engagement between communities, groups and local authorities where there may be tensions, mistrust or negative connotations exacerbated by the pandemic. 
      o Increase access to guidance and awareness of Government support mechanisms, for example Universal Credit, to increase access to employment, education and/or volunteering opportunities.
      o Increase access to guidance, vaccination programmes and public health services, through outreach and practical tools to improve health and wellbeing of residents, especially those from disproportionately impacted groups, and their families. 
      o Increase visibility of Bolder Healthier Community Champions, volunteers and community groups to encourage more mutual aid and volunteer provision able to support local authority delivery.
      
      The provider will lead the delivery of training programmes for community leaders across Birmingham. The provider should consider offering different types of training programmes, comprised of different elements of community leadership. Individuals who undergo the training should be able to implement their learnings in practice, as a placement opportunity. The training programmes should aim to reach seldom heard voices and participants should be diverse in terms of age, ethnicity and cultural background, and socioeconomic demographics. Leadership training must be offered to Bolder Healthier Champions, as well as other key community members who would benefit from the training.

Data from 20212 shows the average duration of a care or supervision case was 45 weeks,  only 23% of cases were disposed of within 26 weeks. 
The inability to resolve cases under PLO within or close to the statutory timeframe of 26 weeks, poses significant problems for the system as a whole in ensuring vulnerable children and families receive appropriate decisions in a timely manner. 
Initial work by Mutual Ventures Ltd from December 2021 to April 2022 (funded by DfE) sought to understand the impact of delays in care proceedings on children's services through the prism of financial costs. A direct output of that programme of work was construction of a modelling tool to analyse the financial impact of family court delays on children's services, populated with the CST/LA cohort to test assumptions, validate and generate outputs. 
DfE would like a provider to support LAs to use this tool, so that LAs can see where their inefficiencies are and take actions to reduce delays and make financial savings.

This procurement is being concluded following a competitive procurement exercise.


Brief Description of Requirement

The project will gather new evidence on investment behaviour in GB renewable electricity generation assets (onshore wind, offshore wind, solar, and biomass), including how such behaviour could be influenced by increased price / market exposure beyond that experienced under the current Contracts for Difference scheme. 

This evidence will be crucial to drive efficient investment in GB renewables and deliver our sector ambitions at the lowest cost to consumers. The results will help us investigate the opportunities (or lack thereof) to operate on a more market led basis with additional price exposure (for generators; currently price exposure is faced by consumers), to be delivered through evolution of the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme and the ongoing Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA).",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue",,Swindon,"SN2 1LF",England,,,"PS22251 - AW4.1 - Order Form  Market Signals and Renewables Investor Behaviour (RAF040-2223) - signed by Frontier - signed by BE.pdf ",,,10/10/2022,31/03/2023,19/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,59995.03,,05/10/2022,59995.03,"[Frontier Economics Limited|71 High Holborn, London, WC1V 6DA|COMPANIES_HOUSE|O3752719|No|No]",,10/10/2022,31/03/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,14:00

NICE195,Contract,"National Institute For Health And Care Excellence",Awarded,2022-10-13T15:16:57+01:00,"Mass AI Beta 2","The AI Multi-Agency Advice Service (MAAS) project is funded by the NHS AI Lab.  The project is a collaboration between four regulatory bodies ('MAAS partners'): 
* the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; with project oversight) provides national guidance and advice to improve health and social care, 
*  the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is the independent regulator of health and social care in England, 
* the Health Research Authority (HRA) provides a unified national system for the governance of health research, and;
* the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) ensures that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.

The aim of the project is to:
*	enable collaboration between the partner agencies to identify challenges and barriers in the regulatory pathway and to resolve these;
*	articulate the regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA; i.e. evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness) pathway clearly for developers and adopters, so they know what they need to do when, who to contact, etc;
*	bring together in one place support, information and advice on the regulation and HTA pathways for artificial intelligence (AI) in health and care, and other data-driven technologies (DDT);
*	identify and tackle 'content gaps' related to the above and in response to priority user needs, and;
*	collaboratively research, test and develop a multi-agency advice service whose form and function best reaches key users and enables them to achieve their goals. Ensuring the design of the service meets the needs of all users, including those with accessibility needs.

The MAAS partners are looking for a digital agency to build upon the findings from testing of the minimum viable product (MVP) in private beta, building new features on the service, and lead the team through private beta testing, and handing over to the home service team following one month running in private beta, and passing the GDS beta assessment.

In line with government funded digital services, a project with a transactional service must pass the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) / Government Digital Services (GDS) assessments to progress to different stages; from private to public beta, and then to live. Therefore, it should be expected that any work undertaken by the supplier as part of this commission, including development of artefacts and user research documentation, will be used in service assessments to move from private to public and therefore should be of a sufficiently high standard. The supplier must participate in this assessment along with the service team and ensure the developed website passes it.",,,"United Kingdom","72000000 ","Sharon Martin",sharon.martin@nice.org.uk,"2nd Floor","2 Redman Place",LONDON,"E20 1JQ",England,"020 7045 2024",,"NICE 195_Redacted.pdf ",,,03/10/2022,28/02/2023,25/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,350000,374825,10/10/2022,374825,"[BJSS LIMITED|1 WHITEHALL QUAY

The ambition for the NHS in England is for MCoC to be the default model of care for maternity services and available to all pregnant women in England, with rollout prioritized to those most likely to experience poorer outcomes. In accordance with the principle of proportionate universalism this means that as continuity of carer is rolled out to most women, women from neighbourhoods with high numbers of women from Black, Asian, and Mixed ethnic groups, and women living in deprived areas are prioritized, with plans for implementation in place by June 2022, with safe staffing and building blocks taken into consideration. The aim is for 75% of women in these groups receiving continuity of carer by March 2024 (Equity and equality Guidance for local maternity systems 2021).

NHS England are working with the Department of Health and Social Care to implement the 15 Immediate & Essential Actions (IEAs) and every trust, ICS and LMS/LMNS Board must consider and then act on the report's findings. In the context of this recommendation, the 1 April letter from the Chief Executive, Chief Nursing and Chief Medical Officers at NHSEI restates the 15th June deliverable for the agreement of MCoC plans staffing. This guidance builds and updates on Delivering Midwifery Continuity of Carer at full scale (October 2021).

Updated system guidance published on the 6th May 2022 within the context of the Final report of the Ockenden review and the Immediate and Essential Actions (IEAS) that relate to Continuity of Carer includes:
• Requirements relating to the agreement of plans to deliver Midwifery Continuity of Carer (MCoC) as the default model of care by March 2024, or to timescales linked to essential recruitment of midwives, as agreed with Regional Boards.
• As part of this, how to use the Assurance Template to summarise plans for regional and national assurance.
• How systems should plan to roll out Enhanced MCoC teams for the most deprived areas, with a view to receiving funding for implementation from Q3 2022/3. Note the enhanced scheme for continuity of carer will be the subject of separate research.

There is now a clear need for an evaluation to be undertaken on the implementation of MCoC to assess its effectiveness, the impact on maternity services, the women who use them and any unintended consequences. This evaluation will also inform the ongoing implementation of MCoC.",,"LS2 7UE",England,"85100000 ","NHSE Commercial Team",england.commercialqueries@nhs.net,"Quarry Hill",,Leeds,"LS2 7UE",GB,,,"nhs-terms-and-conditions-for-the-provision-of-services-contract-version.docx ",,,11/10/2022,31/03/2023,13/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,110000,110000,10/10/2022,98768.05,"[City, University of London|Northampton Square EC1V 0HB|NONE||No|No]",,11/10/2022,31/03/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

The designer should have experience and creativity in working with museum objects and dynamic visitor experiences which includes the digital element. 
      
      The centrepiece of Living Art and Sharing Stories will be in our East End Gallery. This will be composed of two main elements to be sensitively and dynamically interwoven: 
      
      1. The centrepiece, entitled 'Imprisoned Souls', will be a glass box surrounded by objects from the Sainsbury Centre collection. The visitor will enter the glass box, inverting the usual experience of looking at an encased object. Instead, the visitor will be contained and gazed at by the objects, which are on the outside. The designer will work with our curatorial team to select and conceive the display of the objects and this experience.
      2. The second element will be an immersive interactive digital experience allowing visitors to discover content to enrich knowledge about the objects in the Sainsbury Centre collection.  This section will include an area where visitors of different ages can create content.
      
      We are looking for a design that brings these elements together into a single dramatic and emotive experience. 
      
      Furthermore, Living Art and Sharing Stories will extend into the Living Area at the Sainsbury Centre. In this permanent collection display, works from different periods and cultures are juxtaposed in an open plan space so the visitor can take their own journey.

The Authority has secured funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to support delivery of the Killingworth Site Sustainable Retrofit Project. This project is a combination of refurbishment and replacement of existing office accommodation, workshop, welfare and other facilities on the site ensuring it 'future proofs' depot operations. Energy efficiency and functionality are key principles, and the Project will use a wide range of energy efficient, generation and storage/distribution solutions to support a move to an electric powered operational fleet whilst reducing the site carbon footprint. This procurement opportunity relates specifically to Block F Vehicle Maintenance Workshop Refurbishment and North Tyneside Council will act as Principal Contractor for the project, therefore tenderers should note that they will be working in the capacity of Sub-Contractor.

We expect tenderers to liaise closely with the service and out of hours and weekend working will at times be necessary. The Block F site is very restrictive for access / plant movements and therefore it is strongly recommended that Tenderers undertake a site visit, contact details to make arrangements are contained within the Preambles document in the tender pack.

The Experiential Learning elements of the scheme are delivered by the Academy's Faculty, with all other scheme elements delivered by our University partners.
The Experiential Learning programme is focused on developing the capacity of trainees to explore, enhance, adapt and broaden their own leadership understanding, styles and behaviours in addition to providing them with the necessary skills and tools they need to be effective managers and emerging leaders in their current and future roles. It is delivered as a series of modular residential experiences, offered on a 1, 2 or 3-day basis dependent upon the depth and breadth of the design, content and subject area being explored.  
The specification seeks to put in place the additional Actor-Facilitator requirements across the Experiential Learning modules (outlined below), for the September 2022 cohort, as follows:
LOT 1: Module 1 (actors required on Day 3 of Experiential Learning)
Topic: Getting Started
This is the first experiential learning module participants will have encountered since they started the scheme in September 2022. The module will take place in December 2022, face to face.
Module one has 5 key objectives:

•	To introduce the concept and approach of experiential learning
•	To establish the cohort as a learning community where people know one another and are able to support and challenge each other
•	To increase their understanding of the NHS through 4 different lenses - health policy, equality, diversity & inclusion, front line clinical care and finance
•	To increase their awareness of, and develop skills to increase, personal resilience
•	To increase their personal impact (day three) - this day is where we need actors

The module runs over the course of three days, the first day is focused on understanding
understanding experiential learning, understanding each other and understanding the NHS from the
perspective of health policy EDI. Day two continues the exploration of the NHS through the lenses
of finance and direct clinical care before moving on to considering how they protect and enhance their
personal resilience. The final day is about building practical skills to thrive and survive in the health
and care system, with a focus on increasing their personal impact in the virtual and face to face
environments. Over the course of the three days, they will be working with several different

Background

1.1.	As part of the conservation project of HMS Victory there will be a significant increase in the requirement to record the ship accurately in 3D. 
1.1.1.	The laser scanner will be used to capture the ship and its elements as they become exposed, throughout the conservation project.
1.1.2.	The resulting point cloud will be modelled, to augment our existing model, to record changes made, both externally and internally.
1.1.3.	The data is required to be accurate to millimetric precision to create a record of the conservation work to the ship, for future generations and also to be compatible with the existing 3D model.
1.1.4.	We completed our own research and also consulted with a professional survey company and we have decided that the Leica RTC360 3D laser scanner will be most suitable for our needs.
1.1.5.	We have had previous 3D laser scans completed using Leica instruments and software and want all of our files to be compatible with each other.
1.1.6.	We own Leica software and total stations, so we are familiar with the Leica interface. 

Objective

2.1.	After research and consulting industry professionals, it was agreed that a Leica RTC360 3D laser scanner is required, which will meet the requirement to be able to record the data for modelling changes to the ship, as well as positioning the resulting point cloud using GPS capability.  
2.2.	Outright purchase of the scanner is required, with the total price given in the tender cost breakdown.  Additional items may be required, if available.  These additional items are also to be priced separately within the tender cost breakdown:
•	A programme compatible with the laser scanner, such as Leica Cyclone REGISTER full version programme;
•	Warranties that cover damage / replacement;
•	Maintenance packages that cover calibration and servicing.
