This project is a Lowestoft Town Council initiative supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Architectural Heritage Fund, Historic England, Towns Fund and East Suffolk Council. 

The project will transform the Town Hall into a multifunctioning building that will be in the heart of historic Lowestoft and the Harbour Ward, bringing significant footfall to this deprived area.  The building will include a heritage hub, with adjacent gallery, alongside a café and events space.   

Lowestoft Town Council seeks to appoint consultants to research, design, and oversee the implementation of a compelling and interactive heritage experience package.   This will be required to interpret the town's history in a vibrant, interactive, inclusive, engaging and innovative way. The heritage interpretation package will: 
•	set the scene for a non-traditional approach to 'exhibition' design
•	be fully accessible and inclusive 
•	employ a strong graphic design 
•	incorporate local people's stories 
•	engage target audiences: it must entertain as well as inform
•	include content that goes beyond traditional interpretation 
•	include heritage interpretation that engages all ages and abilities
•	offer a range of 'rewards' to visitors, including play, learning, social interaction and reminiscence.

Scope of works & timings: 
To develop the outline interpretation proposals into a fully costed Interpretation Plan.  This will be in three parts, the first two to be completed by late Spring 2023.  Parts 1 and 2 will focus on the development of the interpretation plan,   along with costed designs.  Part 3 is dependent on securing stage 2 NLHF funding, and is expected to run from early 2024 to mid 2025. 

Our maximum budget for Parts 1 & 2 is £47,500 excl VAT to include all expenses; we also seek detailed fee proposals for Part 3, based on an estimated capital cost for manufacture in the region of £375,000. 
 
Key outputs are: 
1.	A detailed and costed Interpretation Plan which identifies and describes the themes and stories that the Town Hall will interpret in order to meet its objectives and achieve outcomes set out within our stage 1 application to the National Lottery Heritage Fund.  
2.	A scheme proposal to RIBA 3, with associated costs for public display/exhibition spaces, artefacts and materials within the proposed redeveloped building.  
3.	Detailed designs for manufacture of components, alongside a specification to support the tender for the same. 
4.	A completed installation at the end of Stage 2 of the project.

Core themes:

Within the scope of this work the following themes will need to shape analysis and form the structure of regular reporting:

Digital vs traditional face-to-face methods:

-	Fairness of recruitment based on protected characteristics
-	Fairness of recruitment based on country of primary qualification 
-	How do face-to-face and digital methods compare in their effectiveness of identifying the most suitable applicants that will continue to be successful in the training programme they have been appointed to?
-	How has applicant behaviour changed?
-	Are applicants applying for training programmes coming through traditional training routes - how has the dynamics changed. For example, are Foundation trainees progressing straight into core training? Are Core Surgical Trainees progressing directly into higher surgical training, or are these posts being awarded by applicants who have applied through a different route?
-	Does level of experience have an impact on fairness and suitability of different recruitment methods (i.e. is digital recruitment fairer in R2 or R1)
-	Does one type of recruitment (i.e Digital vs Traditional) work better for certain staff groups over others. I.e. Is digital recruitment more effective in Dental recruitment vs Pharmacy recruitment",,"LS2 7UE",England,"80000000 ","Philip Scott",philip.scott@hee.nhs.uk,"Quarry House, Quarry Hill",,Leeds,"LS2 7UE",GB,,,"NHSTER~1.doc ",,,07/12/2022,06/12/2024,16/06/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,450000,450000,07/12/2022,300000,"[RSM UK Consulting LLP|Number One Lanyon Quay, Belfast, BT1 3LG|NONE||No|No]",,07/12/2022,06/12/2024,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

This supports TfWM and transport operators' strategic objectives to increase the use of public transport, active travel, and new forms of mobility, thereby ensuring a viable transport network and supporting the #WM2041 initiative.

The outcomes of MaaS will also enhance, complement, and assist with the evaluation of other future transport initiatives in the West Midlands such as e-scooters, Demand Responsive Transport (DRT).

The data sourced from MaaS will also be used to support modelling which supports business cases for enhancing the investment in transport networks in the West Midlands and facilitates the better day-to-day operation of the transport network.

TfWM and its operators define MaaS as a one-stop interface - normally in the form of a mobile app, with which users can plan, book, and pay for a journey across multiple transport modes including public transport and active modes, as well as modes such as cycle hire, car hire, ridesharing, walking, and cycling. MaaS can be used as a tool to influence behavior.

We will help the UK achieve a net zero carbon economy in 2050 and better protect the environment. We aim to help the UK become a global leader in transitioning to a net zero economy by building a coherent, supportive environment enabling people and businesses to innovate.

We face a time limited challenge to achieve net zero by 2050 and recognise the opportunity for businesses to grow to significantly impact this and offer global solutions. Innovative scalable net zero businesses and solutions are needed to reach our net zero targets, however there is a market failure that will prevent many of them from reaching maturity.

Innovate UK wants to convene, create dialogue and action by bringing together the net zero innovation and sector specific investment and procurement communities to accelerate adoption at scale and sector investment. We want to deliver a programme of events and activities that;
- provide opportunities for net zero businesses to engage relevant investors
- give investors insight on market opportunities in the net zero sector
- unlock barriers for net zero businesses to grow and scale, and
- enhance the net zero innovation ecosystem.

We are seeking an external partner to design, develop and deliver this 2 ½ year programme in partnership with Innovate UK, Innovate UK KTN and Innovate UK EDGE. This programme should be delivered with the ambition to grow to be a staple of UK innovation response to net zero by 2050 over the next 30 years.

affecting customers, how customers are affected by decisions taken and/or gain an understanding of highlights, influences, tipping points, pinch points of fisheries management and compliance current undertakings. 

The objectives of the project are:

• Review existing evidence base on perceptions, insights (and attitudes) towards the MMO's fisheries management and compliance activity.

• Identify suitable methodologies, qualitative and quantitative approaches and focus groups on how to gather perceptions and insights data. 

• Provide recommendations how to store and analyse sensitive perceptions and insights data.

• Define key principles for fisheries management and compliance to consider as part of a wider training package.

• Reporting and dissemination of outputs to relevant teams within Marine Operations, and to be confirmed at inception.",,"SW1P 3JR","Any region","73200000 ","Felicity Jowett",felicity.jowett@defra.gov.uk,"Horizon House Deanery Road",,Bristol,"BS1 5AH",UK,,,,,,09/12/2022,31/03/2023,11/11/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,NotApplicable,49350,49350,09/12/2022,49350,"[ICF Consulting Services Limited|ICF Consulting Services Limited Riverscape 10 Queen Street Place London EC4R 1BE|NONE||No|No]",,09/12/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,23:59

Leicester City Council led the procurement on behalf of Leicester City Council and the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Integrated Care Board (LLR ICB), previously known as the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Clinical Commissioning Group (LLR CCG).

Day Opportunities Services support and enable people to access and participate in a variety of activities and opportunities, during the daytime, that help them to meet their social care and/or health needs.

Services will support the delivery of outcomes for people, and their families, who draw on social care support and see them being empowered and supported to participate in opportunities that enable them to meet their agreed outcomes as part of their support plan.

The activities and opportunities available will depend on an individual's needs and interests. General examples may include, but are not limited to, IT training, cooking/baking, confidence building, friendship groups, sports, games and other leisure activities, household management, exercise, mindfulness and meditation, gardening, art therapy, visits to parks, museums or days out.

The Authority has awarded Framework Agreements for each Lot. There is no maximum number of providers to be awarded a Framework Agreement for each Lot. Tenderers should note that Lots 1 to 4 services are commissioned for the Authority only. Lot 5 services are being commissioned for both the Authority and the LLR ICB. The Authority provides no guarantee or volume of any work to any successful provider.

The Authority conducted this procurement under the Light Touch Regime for Social and Other Specific Services, as set out in the Public Contract Regulations 2015 (PCR), at Section 7 (Regulations 74 to 77) and Schedule 3. The procurement process was not conducted under the Public Contract Regulations 2015; however, it was similar to that of an Open procedure. The Process did, unlike an Open Procedure, include the flexibility, as allowed under the Light Touch Regime with various evaluation stages as detailed in the Invitation to Tender documentation.

The Authority has awarded Framework Agreements for each Lot. There is no maximum number of providers to be awarded a Framework Agreement for each Lot.

It is the Authority's preliminary view that TUPE may apply in respect of this Contract.

The proposed Contract will be for an initial period of 4 years to commence on 1st April 2023, with an option to extend, subject to satisfactory performance outcomes and agreement by the Authority, for a further period or periods up to a total of 2 years, taking the contract term to a maximum of 6 years.

The Invitation to Tender document and its appendices and all other documentation issued to Tenderers sets out the details of the Authority's requirements.",,,"East Midlands","85000000 98000000 ","Jasmin Dhonsi",procurement-asc@leicester.gov.uk,"City Hall","115 Charles Street",Leicester,"LE1 1FZ",England,"'+44 1164546125",http://www.leicester.gov.uk,,,,01/04/2023,31/03/2029,25/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,35650000,,06/12/2022,35650000,"[Age UK Leicestershire & Rutland|Lansdowne House, 113 Princess Road East

Brief Description of Requirement

BEIS wishes to improve its understanding of the impact of 'shocks' to the UK economy and has been exploring the use of agent-based modelling to help us do so. This work has been encouraging and BEIS would now like to obtain a model which it can use to carry out analysis as the need arises. 

It is difficult to predict the specific shocks that BEIS may want to investigate using the model. However, recent analyses have explored the impact of supply shortages, labour shortages, demand changes and policy changes resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic.

As well as the direct impact of a shock on businesses and sectors we are interested in understanding how shocks propagate through the supply chain:

-	How large might the impact be in terms of loss of output or firm failures?
-	Which types of firms and/or sectors are likely to be most severely affected?
-	What might the impact on employment be?

This specification is in two parts

Part 1:  the supply of a model

BEIS is looking to obtain a model which allows the propagation of economic shocks throughout the supply chain to be explored and better understood. To do so, BEIS would like to fund either the enhancement of an existing model or the development of a model from scratch.

Part 2:  analysis using the model

In addition to the supply of a model, BEIS may also require the contractor to carry out analysis using the model. This will be an optional extension to the contract.


Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the ITQ document.

Its universal reach provides an invaluable opportunity to identify families that are in need of additional support and children who are at risk of poor outcomes.

Sefton has an age 0-19 population of 59,700; and of those 14,500 are under the age of 5 years. Public Health HCP is currently provided to the 0-19 (up to 25 with SEND) age group through an integrated contract, which includes Health Visiting, School Nursing and an Enhanced Pathway for vulnerable families. The service is fully aligned to NHSEI commissioned Immunisations and Vaccination Programme, and ICB Commissioned Specialist Nursing for Children in Care (CiC), Youth Justice Service and Specialist Safeguarding. 

Under the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, local authorities are responsible for improving the health of their local population and the commissioning of public health services for children and young people 0 to 19 years (up to 25 with SEND). Ensuring every child has the best start in life is one of OHID's (formerly PHE) key priorities. Best Start in Life has been identified as a priority within the national  5-year strategy, which runs from 2020 to 2025. 

A major contribution to achieving these ambitions and strategies is the modernisation of the Healthy Child Programme, which is based on 4 levels of service - community, universal, targeted and specialist, depending on individual and family need.
 
The Service will have a significant role in Sefton and be a lead partner in the Integrated Care System and locality based multi-agency working arrangements. The HCP will be structured in line with the wider Sefton's Children and Young People (C&YP) offer, 'Start Well', which is currently in transformation. It will also align with the development of Family Wellbeing Hubs and the updated Social Care model and will work together to deliver an integrated service for children and young people. The aim is to reduce duplication across the workforce and improve efficiency and the experience of the children, young people, and families that the Service is working with.  
 The Service will work positively with the Council and its partners to transform and improve services and outcomes for children and young people. This may result in additional services being added and changes to the service specification, in accordance with the contract variation provision, during the term of the contract. There will also be an expectation for service provision to flex, responding to changes to national guidance (such as further guidance around the Modernised Healthy Child Programme), or as a result of local transformation.  We are conducting an Open Procedure tender exercise to put the contract in place to run for a period of 5 years with 2 x 12 month options.

CW84183,Contract,"H M Revenue & Customs",Awarded,2023-01-06T11:38:37Z,"Employment Status in the UK","The changing business models in the labour market is one of the biggest challenges facing the tax system, with significant Exchequer impacts and compliance challenges for HMRC. Problems will persist until the employment status system is reformed. 
To make evidenced decisions about reforms, fiscal and economic impacts must be known. Existing data is not sufficient to robustly estimate the size of employment status categories post-pandemic, or determine how individuals might be affected by reforms. New primary research is needed to gather evidence, update previous research findings, behavioural impacts of the current regime, and effects of working through intermediaries.
Despite prior employment status research conducted in 2018, HMRC holds limited data on employment status post-pandemic, and senior decision-makers are increasingly interested in reform. Research is required to provide estimates of the current labour market and determine the extent to which individuals would be affected by reforms.
This research would provide data on types of work individuals undertake against the current employment status criteria, the effects the current regime has on engagement choices by employers/engagers, and which types of engagers workers are involved with and by whom. Qualitative interviews will also help establish the wider impacts of options for reform, as the FST is keen for us to build individual-level data to create case studies of the worker population.
Research is key to informing potential employment status reform and providing employment status data post-pandemic. It will ensure any policy development by HMRC/HMT are evidence-based and focussed on ministerial priorities.
HMRC requires a quantitative survey of individuals to obtain representative demographic and tax-status data on the worker population, followed by 30 qualitative follow-up interviews with individuals and engager's behaviour and decision-making processes when it comes to employment status. This means we can provide estimates of the worker population, and compare the findings to previous research conducted by HMRC.
Employment law recognises three distinct employment categories (employee, worker, self-employed), the tax system only has two: employed and self-employed. The rules determine whether individuals and their engagers pay tax and NICs on an employed or self-employed basis. The rules are open to interpretation and can be difficult for individuals and businesses to apply and for HMRC to enforce, leading to mis-categorisation and loss of tax and NICs for the Exchequer. We have made the case to seniors, FST and CX that the current system is not sustainable and needs reform due to these risks to the Exchequer.",,"M60 3BS",,"73110000 ","Rebecca Yeates",rebecca.yeates@hmrc.gov.uk,"Trinity Bridge House","2 Dearmans Place",Salford,M35BS,England,"03000 585186",,"Contract Docs.zip ",,,15/12/2022,14/06/2024,01/11/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,185000,,12/12/2022,185000,"[NatCen|35 Northampton Square, London, EC1V 0AX|COMPANIES_HOUSE|04392418|Yes|No]",,15/12/2022,14/12/2024,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,16:00

The path is located in Brabourne, Ashford.

The surface of the Bridleway has become extremely muddy and significantly worn at regular intervals with a considerable number of potholes developing, and as a result, suffers from large puddles of water forming during periods of sustained rainfall. Frequent pedestrian, cycle and equestrian traffic along this section, as well as being an access route for agricultural vehicles to and from the neighbouring fields, prevent it from recovering and continued use by these groups will cause its condition to deteriorate further and inhibit use from this range of user groups, particularly during winter months.

The North Downs Way (NDW), which has National Trail status, is a popular and heavily used trail through Kent and recognised and lauded for its spectacular views and fascinating heritage, traversing the Kent Downs Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. By carrying out repairs and improvements to the surface, it will maintain access, allows safe an accessible passage and supports continued and longer-term tourism, as well as sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits.

The integrated laser marking system will replace the current inkjet printers and shall laser mark the cell (can and sleeve) with the relevant data matrix code and cell data information as per the UKBIC technical drawing that will be supplied.

The main requirement for the integrated cell laser marking system is to seamlessly replace the existing inkjet printers within the current cell footprints by integrating a proven laser marking system that will produce reproducible and accurate laser marked battery information including but not limited to ID's, company logos etc, to drawing tolerances. The integrated system must be able to operate within a Clean and Dry room environment inside the current cell envelopes, adhering to all health and safety regulations with respect to laser devices that will keep staff protected from any potential hazards. Fume extraction is integral to the system operation.

Three identical laser marking systems will be required to replace the three existing inkjet printers in the following locations:
•	Cylindrical cell assembly (marked on the cell can) - clean and dry room environment. 
•	Cylindrical cell assembly (marked on the cell sleeve) - external to clean and dry room. 
•	 Pouch cell assembly (marked on the exterior of the pouch housing) - clean and dry room environment. 

The replacement system must be retrofitted to connect to all existing services in the cell assembly area and all effort should be made to minimise potential changes to the line that would incur additional spend. The laser markings IDs must be capable of being read with 100% accuracy by the Keyence vision systems that are installed to inspect the cell IDs.

The 185 is a commercial service and its withdrawal will impact over 21,272 passenger journeys per year.  

High Peak Buses has cited commercial viability as the prime reason for the withdrawal, however, driver shortages and retentions have also contributed to the operational difficulties. 

A local Councillor has expressed a disappointment over the prospect of the 185 being withdrawn and explained that there will be missed opportunities along the route to serve new residential areas. The public are dissatisfied by the loss and have explained the importance of retaining this travel link.  

The Council is certain that the withdrawal of the 185 service will have a negative impact on the communities it serves. For instance, under the proposals, the Fairfield Estate, an area of deprivation, will be left without a bus service and sufficient access to much needed local amenities such as shops and healthcare.

The data to be collected and subsequent analysis will be proposed by the UK fishing/seafood industry in collaboration with an appropriate research organisation. Defra requires data to be collected in established ways, as set out in the appropriate MEDIN data collection standards (Marine Environmental Data and Information Network), openly published on the appropriate MEDIN data archive centre, and to publish a scientific report that sets out the data collected, the methodology used and analysis of that data.

The increase in available data and the improvement of knowledge will benefit the UK Government and the UK seafood industry by providing a greater understanding of UK fish stocks and the interaction with other species and the marine environment, which can be used to support UK fisheries policy development and management.

The tender is divided into Lots as described below, Tenderers may bid for contracts under more than one of the Lots, as applicable.

Lot 1 Fisheries Data Collection - Will address key knowledge gaps to develop assessment and management approaches, including on biological processes such as growth and maturity, ecological processes such as predator-prey relationships, habitat availability/change, mixed-usage water space and stock definition. Projects on data-limited stocks and species are particularly required.

Lot 2 Mixed Fisheries, Selectivity and Environmental Impacts of Fishing - Will support developing and evaluating new measures that improve the protection of vulnerable stocks while maintaining viable fisheries. The Fishery Fund can support the development and implementation of a UK catch and discard policy, ensuring it is evidence-based and developed with input from the fishing industry.

Lot 3 Environmental Impacts of Aquaculture - Focuses on two areas:
1) better understanding the ecosystem benefits of aquaculture
2) how the environmental impacts of existing systems can be minimised.

CW83936,Contract,"H M Revenue & Customs",Awarded,2022-12-20T15:37:56Z,"The Take Up Of Child Benefit","Child Benefit (ChB) take-up rates have fallen more sharply than expected since the pandemic began. By August 2021, the number of children under-one in families receiving ChB payments was 12% lower than the pre-pandemic level (February 2020). Claims have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.

A mixed-method approach research project is therefore needed to understand why some eligible parents are not applying for benefits to which they are entitled. This will enable targeted communications and help ensure HMRC is paying out right levels of support when the cost of living is increasing and supporting parents to access the non-monetary benefits associated with a ChB claim.   

ChB is a relatively straightforward welfare product, providing support to those responsible for children up to the age of 16, or until 20 if they stay in approved education or training. Entitlement is irrespective of individual income, but if the claimant and/or their partner earns over £50,000 they will be in scope for the High-Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) unless they opt out of receiving payments. Child Benefit provides a valuable contribution towards the increasing cost of living, food, clothing and other expenses- particularly essential in recovery from the pandemic. External research indicates child poverty has increased throughout the pandemic and ChB is a key welfare product in tackling child poverty.
The research will support HMRC's objective to maximise support/welfare provided by ChB to families with children. By understanding barriers to claiming ChB we can better target our Comms to customer cohorts to improve ChB take up. Changes made as a result of the research have potential to promote ChB and improve customer journeys for the associated non-monetary benefits too.",,,"United Kingdom","73000000 ","Husain Akubat",husain.akubat@hmrc.gov.uk,"1st Floor Trinity Bridge House 2 Dearmans Place",Salford,Manchester,"M3 5BS",England,"03000 578308",,"Redacted Order Schedules.zip ",,,30/11/2022,29/11/2023,18/10/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,160000,,06/12/2022,119900,"[BMG RESEARCH LTD|Beech House, Greenfield Crescent,Edgbaston

This is a Department for Education Funded programme to deliver holiday activities, including a meal, to eligible children and their families during the Easter, Summer and Christmas school holiday.

This holiday provision is for school aged children from reception to year 11 (inclusive) who receive benefits-related free school meals. Local authorities have discretion to use up to 15% of their funding to provide free or subsidised holiday club places for children who are not in receipt of benefits-related free school meals but who the local authority believe could benefit from HAF provision.

The Department for Education have confirmed that funding will continue to be available until at least 2025. The Council is therefore procuring a supplier to deliver the service for two years (until the end of the 2024-25 financial year, with the option to extend for a further 2 years (1+1) should further funding be available).

The supplier is responsible for ensuring there is a sufficient supply of places for eligible children to attend Holiday Activity and Food programme provision in each of the holiday periods.

It is not expected that the supplier will deliver services directly themselves but that they will work with local deliver partners who will deliver the services to children, young people and their families.  

Overall, the supplier is expected to offer the equivalent of 6 weeks' holiday provision to eligible children.

Over Easter:
 - we expect that all participating children should benefit from at least a week of face-to-face provision at Easter, which should be for a minimum of 4 days
- for most children, each day at Easter should consist of at least 4 hours of provision, but the local authority should ensure that provision is tailored to need

Over summer:
- participating children should be offered at least 4 weeks of face-to-face provision, which cover a minimum of 16 days
- for most children, each day during summer should consist of at least 4 hours of provision, but the local authority should ensure that provision is tailored to need

Over Christmas:
- we expect that all participating children should benefit from a week of support which covers a minimum of 4 days
- for most children, each day of face-to-face provision at Christmas should consist of at least 4 hours of provision but the local authority should ensure that provision is tailored to need.",,,"East Midlands","85000000 ","North Northamptonshire Procurement Team",procurement@northnorthants.gov.uk,"Sheerness House","41 Meadow Road",Kettering,NN168TL,England,,,,,"Please visit the North Northamptonshire Council e-Procurement Portal (https://in-tendhost.co.uk/nnc/aspx/Home) to express an interest in this opportunity and to access the tender documentation.",01/03/2023,28/02/2027,28/10/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,4400000,,08/12/2022,4400000,"[Northamptonshire Sport|Delapre Abbey, London Road, Northampton, NN4 8AW|CHARITY_COMMISSION|017997|Yes|No]",,01/03/2023,28/02/2027,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

Encompassing themes including business competitiveness and building new capacity, the WEST Programme aims to support growth of offshore wind supply chain companies through specialist advice, market intelligence and business planning. WEST is a short, ""foundation"" activity that includes the assessment of a company's needs, provision of support, feedback and recommendations of next steps and action plans for further support as and where this might be required. Despite being described as a ""foundation"" programme the term used is relative compared to the intensity of other OWGP support programmes. It follows that participant companies will range from low sector maturity to mature and even expert, requiring focused support to address their long-term strategic aims in Offshore Wind. WEST will be delivered by the Consultant (referred to in the programme as a Delivery Partner) and provide a handson needs-focused approach to business support. The WEST Programme will additionally provide OWGP with an understanding of the needs of the supply chain to better inform future intervention activities and business transformation offerings. 

The WEST Programme Framework will be a multi-supplier Framework Agreement. It is anticipated that around eight (8) to ten (10) suppliers will be appointed to the Framework. However, the OWGP reserves the right to appoint fewer or more than this number if deemed

The (MoJ) is exploring the impact of interventions such as Alternative Dispute Resolution and early legal advice on the outcomes of different types of legal disputes. The MoJ is interested in understanding the range of costs to different parties (such as individuals, business, government) connected to a legal dispute. For example, for an individual a dispute could involve both the cost of accessing legal advice and the emotional cost (such as stress, anxiety, absence from work through ill health, etc).  

A legal dispute refers to any action, suit or proceeding between parties in connection with a disagreement. Legal disputes take many forms, ranging from minor consumer issues to personal injury, employment, welfare, family, and commercial matters, and involve a range of services along the way. The MoJ Legal Needs Survey (2015)  found that almost a third of adults (32%) reported that they had experienced one or more of the civil, administrative or family legal problems in the 18 months before interview.

Whilst robust policing and investigations alongside effective victim support services go some way to address the symptoms of domestic abuse and violence, it is recognised that perpetrator intervention approaches, which can involve programmes to address behaviours, are necessary to change behaviours and deal with the root cause of offending. It is the OPCCN and partnership philosophy that victims cannot be supported successfully without a whole system approach including perpetrator prevention, provision of services, partnership working and pursue through tactical means.   

The specification for this service is to deliver behaviour change interventions which aims to prevent a perpetrator reoffending and reduce the risk to victims/children.

The specification for this targeted support service is to: 
•	work closely with a wide range of statutory/non-statutory agencies 
•	enable perpetrators to access interventions to address their abusive behaviour
•	support behaviour change
•	safeguard victims/survivors and children working with current DA service provision

The service will deliver tailored interventions offered in a community setting in a structured manner within the county of Norfolk, that are fully accessible 
•	regardless of geographical locations that are suitable and easily accessible by those receiving support 
•	for those less represented groups, such as female perpetrators, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT+), (British English) black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) as well as those with manageable learning disabilities and mental health needs.

In both Cambridge City and South Cambridgeshire records relating to Section 106 agreements are recorded in bespoke Microsoft Access databases. Both the Cambridge City Council and the South Cambridgeshire databases maintains records relating to around 1,500 developments, respectively. In addition, Cambridge City Council also maintains a dormant database containing information on around 500 developments. Records on how section 106 monies have been spent are held separately.

Recent internal audits for the Councils highlighted weaknesses with the current systems and recommended the implementation of a new holistic database incorporating both information on the section 106 agreement and project spend management. At the same time Regulations (the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 as amended) require annual Infrastructure funding statement and associated datasheets to the Government.

The project must therefore deliver an established and nationally recognised Planning Obligation Administration software system satisfying the following objectives:

•	Ability for multiple Council departments to access data and maintain records
•	A public interface providing read only access to information by third parties
•	Ability to generate pre-population reports including the Infrastructure Funding Statement and Annual Monitoring Report
•	Ability to generate CSV files in accordance with Government guidance (Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government)
•	Ability to create bespoke reports on any information field
•	Ability to create system notifications for when site visits or obligations (including contributions) become due
•	Ability to link with the TechnologyOne finance system

Further information on minimum System requirements is contained in Section 2.

The project will also deliver, as a minimum, a data migration of planning application records held by the Councils respective databases where a Section 106 agreement exists and transfer mapping information from the Idox based Total Land Charges system.

Applicants are also invited to propose solutions on data transfer from existing systems which the Council will consider separately. Data migration fees should be presented on a day rate basis.

There is a need to ensure that the voluntary service commissioned by the ICB is equitable across BNSSG and meets the wider aims for perinatal mental health as part of our response to the NHS Long Term Plan (LTP). The ICB will be working with a collaborative of its existing providers to deliver the following objectives:

•	To deliver a service that helps to support women in and out of the specialist perinatal service within Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP).
•	The service needs to target specific groups that are underserved in the area and support them to access the specialist team (different ethnicities, LGBTQ+, socially deprived areas etc).
•	To ensure that the service helps to support the aims of the LTP, for example increasing the offer for partners and developing the parent infant relationship.

The providers within the collaboration will be those the ICB currently contracts with which are Bluebell, Mothers For Mothers, Homestart North Somerset and Rockabye.

The redesign process will take place between January-March 2023, with a plan for the new service to be implemented during the 23/24 financial year. The contract length will be for 5 years from 23/24 and each provider will hold a separate contract with the ICB which will include an MOU detailing their agreement to work in collaboration with the other providers. The value of this notice is £125k per year, totalling £625k for the full 5-year contract. The exact value of each individual contract within the re-design process will be determined as part of the collaborative work. Historically the contracts within Perinatal Mental Health have only been for 1 year, this has resulted in provider instability. Awarding a 5-year contract will ensure that providers have the security they need to focus solely on service delivery.",,,"South West","85100000 85323000 ","Michael Pingstone",Michael.pingstone@nhs.net,"THREE SIX ZERO",,BRISTOL,BS13NX,England,,,,,,01/04/2023,31/03/2028,05/01/2023,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,650000,,06/12/2022,650000,"[Bluebell Care Trust|Bluebell Place, 2 Quay St, Bristol, BS1 2JL|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes][Homestart North Somerset|Office 3, Locking Road Business Park, 110 Locking Road, Weston super Mare, North Somerset, BS23 3HF|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes][MothersForMothers|New Fulford Family Centre , 237-239 Gate House Avenue, Bristol, BS13 9AQ|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes][Rockabye|25 Upper Belmont Road, Bristol BS7 9DG|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes]",,01/04/2023,31/03/2028,"Other Not applicable",,12:00

      BACKGROUND
      The council entered into a 25-year PFI contract in June 2010 to provide highway maintenance and management services on its 2,500+km highway network. The contract is with Birmingham Highways Ltd (BHL), which delivers the Services through a subcontractor. 
      The Highway Maintenance and Management PFI (HMMPFI) contract is the primary means through which the council discharges its statutory duties (predominantly under Highways Act, 1980 and New Roads and Streetworks Act, 1991) to maintain public highways for which it is the relevant authority.
      The HMMPFI contract was subject to a settlement in June 2019 whereby:
      i. The subcontractor was replaced with an interim subcontractor; and
      ii. The council worked with BHL to:
              (a) restructure the contract; and
              (b) procure a long-term replacement subcontractor.
      The procurement of a long-term replacement subcontractor is currently underway, with dialogue due to complete at the end of November 2022. The restructuring of the contract is expected to be completed in February 2023, subject to:
      i. Receiving compliant and acceptable tenders;
      ii. Approval of the council's revised business case with government; and
      iii. Approval from BHL's senior creditors.
      
      Subject to this process, the long-term replacement subcontract is expected to be signed in April 2023 and commence on 1 September 2023.  
      
      SCOPE OF THIS CONTRACT
      This restructuring support contract relates to advisory services for restructuring of the council's Highway Maintenance and Management PFI contract, together with consequences that arise out of the restructuring of the contract. Such consequences include (but are not exclusively limited to):
      i. Advice to the council relating to alternative positions should it not be possible to complete a restructuring of the contract;
      ii. The council's funding for highway maintenance and management services from HM Government;
      iii. Mobilisation for longer-term highway maintenance and management services;
      iv. Any litigation related to the contract or successor arrangements.
