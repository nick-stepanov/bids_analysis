The Bowl is a 1936 Art Deco style theatre bowl with a stage and backstage designed by Alfred Ridout located in a natural amphitheatre and is one of only a handful of its kind in the country. Although itself not listed, the park and other features such as the Victorian bandstand and kiosk are Grade II listed. The Bowl is being used for music and theatre performances but needs repair and renovation to preserve its unique heritage and facility expansion to meet the developing needs of community and commercial use for residents and businesses.

Central Swindon South Parish Council seeks to appoint an architect experienced in performance spaces, historic buildings and landscaping to develop concept options and drawings governing the renovation of and improvements to The Bowl, Town Gardens, Swindon.

In addition to making the building structurally sound, the Council would like to insulate the building, improve the access to the rear, upgrade mechanical and electrical services, add backstage changing rooms, add disability access, as well as storage space and facilities, improve drainage in the auditorium area and install toilets for performers and the audience. The Council would also like to explore opportunities for sustainable and off-grid solutions, e.g. air-source heat, geothermal, wind turbine and/or solar photovoltaic installations.

The Care Act 2014 and the Children's and Families Act 2014 enhanced the rights of Young Carers in their access to Young Carers Assessments, moving from an explicit request for an assessment to a duty for the local authority to be actively identifying their Young Carers and offering an assessment of need.
      
      There are an estimated 5000 young people providing care in Coventry and although we know that many of these children will not require substantial support throughout their caring role, many do and require ongoing support throughout their childhood to support their caring role.  A key role in this is the identification of Young Carers and raising awareness.  
      
      Coventry City Council is seeking an external provider who will complete the statutory function of Young Carers Needs Assessments on behalf of the Council through a delegated responsibility under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989.  It will support the local authority in identifying Young Carers in the Coventry area and provide Young Carers/families with information and advice at an early stage. The outcomes of the services for Young Carers will include:  
      Enjoy good physical and mental health
      Are safe and protected from harm
      Enjoy life and achieve their aspirations
      Make a positive contribution to their community

Across the site, there are several examples of equipment underperformance including reduced throughput, high levels of planned and unplanned maintenance, unstable operations, equipment availability.  Current methods of asset maintenance are either planned (based on elapsed time from installation) unplanned (reactive)  These methods are as opposed to the approach of maintenance which is informed by actual asset use or its condition. As a result, the root causes of asset underperformance are not being fully identified and addressed and can cause repeat events. In response to this the Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) programme at SL has identified a need to develop predictive asset management problem solving capabilities that are underpinned by data and the application of data science methods to inform decisions. This capability has been broadly termed Industrial Reliability and Performance Improvement (IRPI). IRPI is at a relatively early stage of capability development currently defining its scope of work.  As maintenance is either planned or unplanned currently, there is no strategy to change to a predictive maintenance regime within the current constraints and processes.",,,"North West","79313000 ","Martin  Ellicott",Martin.x.ellicott@sellafieldsites.com,"Calder Bridge",,Seascale,"CA20 1PG",ENG,"'+44 7855149009",https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/shared-services-alliance-ssa-for-nuclear-decommissioning-estate,,"https://sharedsystems.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=16152&B=SELLAFIELD https://sharedsystems.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/3510 ",,17/02/2023,31/05/2023,02/12/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,97200,,13/12/2022,97200,"[Ada-Mode|77-81 Alma Road

These are referred to as the MoJ Constructor Services Frameworks or ""Frameworks"". Bespoke frameworks have been prepared for each value band. 

The MoJ Constructor Services Frameworks have a potential future total combined spend of up to £2.5 billion over a five-year duration, with the possibility of £1 billion of additional spend should the Frameworks across all three value bands be extended for a period of two years.

The MoJ Constructor Services Frameworks will be for use across the department and will see contracts awarded to suppliers for the delivery of construction works and related activities. These activities will include, but not be limited to, new build, refurbishment, maintenance and minor works and associated services. Bespoke frameworks have been prepared for each value band. The three Construction Frameworks are referred to as Framework A, Framework B, Framework C. 

Frameworks A and B are further broken down into four regions. Each region within each value band is being procured through a different Lot and therefore subject to a separate competition.Framework C will establish a single national framework and is therefore covered by a single Lot.

Framework A comprises of Four (4) Lots (Regions) for the Constructor Services for projects with an individual value up to £5m. Anticipated total value of this Framework over five (5) years is expected to be £1.116bn. 

Framework B comprises of Four (4) Lots (Regions) for the Constructor Services for projects with an individual anticipated value between £5m and £10m. Anticipated total value of this Framework over five (5) years is expected to be £750m.

Ofcom has duties to promote media literacy and will soon become the regulator with responsibility for online safety. Our programme for delivering our media literacy duties and preparing for upcoming online safety duties includes building an evidence base about what works when delivering media literacy initiatives which promote online safety, in particular for vulnerable groups which are currently underserved by the media literacy sector.  

Through this commissioning process we will commission and evaluate online media literacy intervention pilots in order to develop this evidence base. 

We know that online media literacy levels are uneven across the UK and that some communities are significantly underserved by current interventions. The focus of this commission is to target communities by meeting them where they are. We are looking for targeted, hyperlocal interventions that help to develop the online safety of people within their community. By hyperlocal we mean interventions that are tightly targeted at a specific community within a tightly geographically bounded area.  Interventions will need to respond to a need identified in and/or by that hyperlocal community. The intervention might include one or more of the following, but is not limited to: 

-	Setting them up for success as a new user of devices, platforms and online content 
-	Safeguarding and increased awareness of how to stay safe online

This change of viewing is impacting different viewers at different rates, depending on their viewing habits and levels of confidence with technology. There is a risk that some viewers are left behind as services become more difficult or complicated to access.

Ofcom has a requirement for research, analysis and design principle development to help understand the impact of TV interfaces on how consumers in vulnerable circumstances ('vulnerable consumers') find and watch TV services and to develop initial proposals for how interfaces could be designed in the future to address these concerns.

This work will explore the biggest barriers and difficulties vulnerable consumers are likely to have with TV interfaces and set out some principles for interface design that might address these barriers in the future.

The platform should be easy to use with set up and walk away features and be able to utilise a range of freely available reagents from various competitive suppliers.  It should also be able to be operated in a high-throughput manner with options for multi-slide loading and automated staining/imaging as one unit.  The system must also come with dedicated data analysis options to include single cell segmentation, phenotypic exploration, and spatial mapping.  The system will be operated and supported by the Newcastle Flow Cytometry and Single cell analysis core facility team as a collaboration with the Bio-Imaging Unit.

As part of this, we are responsible for understanding the technologies that are deployed on online platforms and how this is likely to evolve in the future, as input to our policies and our operational approach to regulating these services. We also work within Ofcom's duties to enable and encourage innovation and appropriate technical standards. 

Smart speakers and other devices with in-built voice assistants are becoming an integral part of many people's homes and lives. Smart speakers are owned or used by a third of all UK adults and account for 6% of all audio consumption. 64% of audio consumed on a smart speaker is live radio. These devices support a range of online and domestic services such as search, tv/radio services, online shopping and the management of smart home devices. Smart Speakers have a particularly important role to play in the lives of people who do not like using traditional interfaces and could play even more significant role in the lives of the elderly or incapacitated.  Smart speakers offer new ways of accessing and engaging with technology which are human-like and more flexible when compared with other consumer devices. 

Ofcom is interested in understanding how smart speakers work and interact with other elements of their ecosystem. We expect this research to improve our understanding of the technology supporting the delivery of services on smart speakers, especially understanding of the access that various content providers have to the UK audience. We expect that our findings from this project will further facilitate the discharge of our imminent duties in the regulation of online harms.",,,"Any region","72222000 73210000 ",,sarah.jones@ofcom.org.uk,"Riverside House",,London,"SE1 9HA",England,,,,,,13/12/2022,31/03/2023,11/11/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,91300,,13/12/2022,91300,"[MTM London Ltd|65 Chandos Place, London, WC2N 4HG|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,13/12/2022,31/03/2023,"CompetitiveQuotationNonOJEU ",,12:00

On 6th April 2008, section 68 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (CNEA 2005) came into force.  This removed from the legislation any requirement for the Police to seize stray dogs or to accept any brought to them.  As a result, Local Authority duties were extended, and they now have sole responsibility for discharging all stray dog functions.

The Local Authority therefore has a duty to collect and detain stray dogs for a period of seven (7) days, after which their ownership passes to the Council. Local Authorities also have a duty to return seized dogs to their owners and keep a register of such stray dogs.

Upon arrival in the UK, the recruits undergo health screening, helminths/parasite infections including strongyloides. 

 
Research has shown that the presence of helminths infection (present in approximately 25% of recruits) was associated with a false negative Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) test and recommended that those who had a helminths infection should have their IGRA test repeated after treatment to exclude Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI).  The implications are that a small proportion of those who are incorrectly diagnosed will go on to develop active Tuberculosis (TB). 

 

This requirement is for the provision Helminths Screening Testing Services for the Gurkha recruitment intake of approximately 400 personnel annually for the length of the contract. 

The Contractor will provide the stool specimen pots and serology tubes for each recruit plus an extra 10% in case of repeats/breakages.  These should arrive at the Authority's premises at the Initial Training Centre (ITC) Catterick. For the Gurkha recruitment intake of approximately 400 personnel the MOD requires:

The closing time and date for receipt of these tenders are fixed and are non-negotiable. It is your responsibility to ensure that any tenders submitted are received by us in time.

In considering these tenders, contained within the document is our proposed marking matrix, noting that with all of these areas, should a clear winner of the tender(s) not emerge, we will be applying some additional internal weighting, and this is entirely at the discretion of Colne Town Council (CTC) whether applied or not.

We aim to inform the successful tenderer by 12th December , with a view to an implementation meeting in week commencing Monday, 23rd January 2023 and Tenderers must be available at this time in order that we can agree practicalities of operation and final contract terms.  Applicants should note that CTC standard terms and conditions as per Appendix TC1, will apply subject to any agreed amendments between the parties.

You are also asked to note that this/these contract(s) will attract financial penalties if performance does not meet specified outputs, potentially escalating to termination of the contract(s).

CTC will, at its discretion, provide an overview of where applicants may not have been successful but in broad terms only.

All costs involved in your tender preparation are for your own account and in deciding to submit any Tenders for our consideration, you hereby accept that CTC cannot be held liable for any costs so incurred by you in connection with the preparation of this tender.  

CTC may accompany a tenderer on a second site visit(s) if this is required. However, the information is contained within the appendices that should enable this Tender submission to be carried out.

Should any clarification be required, you are more than welcome to contact me after Monday 31st October either by email, phone or in person (by appointment); I will do my best to clarify any issues you are not clear on. If in doing so, this reveals a significant issue not covered in the original tender documentation, I would then seek to advise all tenderers of such an issue, to ensure fairness of the process.

As part of this process you should accompany your tender submission with two written references from your existing customers as to your professional competence, reliability and suitability to carry out these proposed works. 

Failure to provide references will automatically disqualify you from the tender process. 
Finally, in closing, thank you in advance for taking the time to consider this tender, and I look forward to receiving it.

This research is needed because CIDD has been challenged by the Customer Experience Committee to demonstrate the fiscal benefits of a focus on customer experience.

The tender is divided into separate Lots:  
LOT 1: Focuses on standard combustion gases and inflame measurements (ideally including space for additional analyser under Lot 2 and Lot 3). The system needs to be able to measure gases according to 'Table 2.1 - LOT 1 gas analysers required' 

LOT 2: Covers additional requirements for hydrogen and methane analysis for process gas monitoring (as a standalone analyser or integrated into LOT 1). With gas concentration encountered summarised in ""Table 2.2. Approximate gas compositions encountered on site (typically values/upper ranges)"" in the light blue boxes.

LOT 3: Covers ultra low level (ppb) trace gas analysis of sulphur compounds in natural gas, CO2 stream or flue gas, to include at the lowest range approximately 0-50ppb (as a standalone analyser or integrated into LOT 1 or LOT 2). 

The purpose of this analyser is process monitoring of MCFC feed gas quality. The species of interests include SO2 (essential requirement), and it is an advantage if it can also measure other sulphur containing compounds such as: H2S, COS, CS2.

Brief Description of Requirement

UK Shared Business Services (UK SBS), on behalf of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), Medical Research Council (MRC) wishes to establish a Contract for the provision of Legal Services for seven (7) years.

UK SBS is managing this procurement process in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (as may be amended from time to time) (the ""Regulations""). 

Introduction

The Medical Research Council (MRC) currently funds its 21 units via legal agreements (Strategic Alliance Agreements) with the University in which the unit is hosted. These legal agreements cover all aspects of the unit operating model. Outside of this arrangement, 4 units are funded directly by the MRC and are managed by a Director reporting to the MRC Management Board.

The MRC Council has approved proposals to establish a new approach to supporting (funding) the units and these changes represent one of the most significant funding policy shifts in the past decade. The changes to the funding models will be made in consultation with the host University (or Research Organisation) and MRC Directors or their equivalent and will require legal advice to manage changes to funding which will include establishing new units, closing existing units and transitioning units from the current funding model to the new model. The contracted legal team will need to highlight areas of risk, propose risk mitigation and provide legal advice to ensure that contractual changes  and new legal documents and/or award funding clauses are completed in a timely manner, working with other lawyers,  the host University or (Research Organisation) and MRC staff as appropriate.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

NNC00000202,Contract,"North Northamptonshire Council",Awarded,2022-12-20T12:40:26Z,"NNC / WNC- NHS Health Checks DPS (Dynamic Purchasing system)","The NHS Health Check programme aims to reduce avoidable premature mortality by early identification and management of cardiovascular risk factors and disease in people aged between 40 and 74 years who have no previous history of CVD disease. In Northamptonshire, 75 in every 100,000 people die prematurely before the age of 75 from cardiovascular disease. Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, local authorities have a legal responsibility to commission and monitor their local health check programme. All local authorities must offer an NHS Health Check to 100% of their eligible population every 5 years by inviting 20% of the eligible population each year over the five year period. In Northamptonshire 228,466 people are eligible for an NHS Health Check meaning that 45,694 people should be offered a check each year. Public Health England expect that 66% of health checks offered should be taken up equating to 27,417 checks delivered each year.

In 2016 the council undertook a procurement exercise to commission pilot services for social inclusion and homelessness services which could best meet local needs and deliver outcomes. The pilot originally came about following agreement between the council and Hampshire County Council (HCC), whereby grant funding previously attributable to Supporting People was combined with the council's own revenue resources. 

Following the successful previous commission and subsequent successful operation of the pilot models the existing contracts will run until 31st March 2023. Following a review of the existing operations and previous commission the council; with agreement with HCC is now looking to commission new contracts for the homelessness and social inclusion services. HCC agreed a reduction in spend on County Council funded Homelessness Support Services in 2022 and to a new grant agreement with Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council for 2023-2026, as such the lot structure and contracts have been re-established for this commission as outlined below:
 
Lot 1 - Emergency Access Homelessness Accommodation and Support (maximum grant available £350,000 per annum)
Lot 2 - Targeted Rough Sleeper Outreach, Floating and In-Reach Resettlement Support (maximum grant available of £155,000 per annum)
Lot 3 - Short to Medium Term Accommodation with Support (maximum grant available of £215,000 per annum)
Tenderers can bid for one or more Lots; though each Lot will be evaluated separately, and response documents must be provided for each lot that the tenderer is responding to.

The requirements of services will continue to be funded by Hampshire County Council through a devolved grant to Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council together with funding from BDBC. The services will be funded from 1 April 2023 until 31st March 2026, subject to any earlier determination by HCC and it is therefore the council's intention to enter into contract(s) with the successful tenderer(s) of each Lot for a period of 3 years. If satisfied with the performance and operation of the contracts; and subject to further annual determinations by HCC the Council may extend the contracts beyond the initial 3-year term by a further period(s) of 12 months for up to a further 3 years. All extensions shall be subject to any earlier determination from HCC following their annal funding review processes.
