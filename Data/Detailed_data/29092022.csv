• For direct emissions (the NHS Carbon Footprint) to reach net zero by 2040, with an ambition to reach an 80% reduction by 2028 to 2032.
• For the emissions influenced by the NHS e.g. purchased energy (the NHS Carbon Footprint Plus) to be net zero by 2045, with an ambition to reach an 80% reduction by 2036 to 2039.

In a fast-paced and demanding environment with a very high patient flow, it is critical that all staff working in the Emergency Department have access to clear and simple guidance and support to ensure their department is working towards the NHS net zero target. We anticipate that a framework, with clear evidence-based steps on the actions to be taken to make an emergency department a net zero ED, will be needed to meet this objective.

This piece of work will make an important contribution to advancing the understanding of the scale of BNG needed in Somerset, and how it can be delivered. 

This piece of work is funded through the Somerset Wetlands Nature Recovery Project (NRP). This is a landscape scale project, focusing on recovering nature across 60,000 hectares of wetland on the Somerset Levels and Moors. A portion of Natural England's BNG funding has been allocated to Nature Recovery Projects, to allow them to be a vehicle for developing BNG within a local area. 

This piece of work aims to develop the understanding of BNG in Somerset through the completion of the following work items:

1. Carrying out a market analysis of the number of BNG units required to deliver the known and forecast development needs for the whole of the Somerset County area.

2. Producing a case study selected from a smaller area within the Nature Recovery Project that demonstrates how BNG units can be delivered within the Nature Recovery Project, how these units would integrate with other finance initiatives such as carbon credits and nutrient credits, and the role played by the Local Nature Recovery Strategy.

3. Delivering a workshop for developers in Somerset to share the results of this work and start early stage discussions on the implementation of BNG in Somerset.

These work items will achieve the following aims:

1. The scale of BNG required within Somerset will be better understood. 

2. The way in which BNG can be used to deliver the Nature Recovery Projects outcomes will be better understood, including how these integrate with other tools such as carbon credits, nutrient  and the Local Nature Recovery Strategy. 

3.

Mobile sediment bedforms (such as sandwaves and megaripples), which actively migrate across the seabed, have the potential to expose cables.  In turn, cable exposure could result in scour (or secondary scour) and the removal of seabed sediments. Uncertainty regarding cable burial success and maintaining cable burial status for the lifetime of a project, needs to be addressed. the aims of this project are:  

1. Literature review of current information on seabed mobility projects and outcomes.

2. Collation of current data available from developers.

3. Analysis of available data to identify seabed changes over time, bedform migration rates and trends in erosion/accretion.

4. Correlation of data and instances of cable exposure to ascertain patterns in the seabed changes and occurrences of cable exposure.

5. Categorise the seabed geomorphodynamics and sediment types.

6. Classify sediment mobilisation to facilitate predictions of future sediment distribution.

7. Ascertain whether other marine users (i.e. fisheries, aggregates) influence the requirement of external protection.

KCC is responsible for providing more than 300 public services such as education, transport, strategic planning, social services, public safety, and waste disposal. The organisation spends a sizeable amount of its budget purchasing various of good and services to meet its responsibilities. To meet these responsibilities, it is key to a have a reliable, useful eProcurement system that allows KCC to procure goods, services and works by following a uniform, systematic, efficient and cost-effective procedure in accordance with all relevant rules and regulations. 

The principle in public buying is to carry out procurements to a specified quality at the most competitive price in a fair and transparent way, which is embedded in UK Law when spending public money. The eProcurement system must adhere to these principles without fail and ensure the users of system - both buyers and suppliers - are aligned in this.

The Northumbria VRU uses a Public Health Approach to tackle violent crime by working collaboratively with police, local government, health agencies, education representatives and other community representatives to address the underlying causes of serious violence.

The VRU recognises the need for earlier intervention to strengthen the co-ordinated community response to domestic abuse.  Families, friends and community members are usually the first to know, and often the best placed to offer support, if someone they know is being controlled, scared or hurt by a partner or family member.  

The VRU is therefore seeking to match fund the Findaway Project to enable it to work across Northumbria to fill a current gap in the community response to domestic abuse.  The service is not aimed at victims or perpetrators as there are already services in place providing that support - instead it is aimed at those informal networks who are close to the victim or the person who is causing the harm. Findaway seeks to equip families, friends and communities with the knowledge and skills they need to effectively support the people they care about.",,,"North East","80000000 ","Liam Shuttleworth",liam.shuttleworth@northumbria.police.uk,"Forth Banks",,"Newcastle upon Tyne",NE13PH,England,447736463090,,,,,07/11/2022,06/11/2025,01/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,105000,,28/09/2022,105000,"[Wearside Women in Need|28 Bridge House, Sunderland, SR1 1TE|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes]",,07/11/2022,06/11/2025,"Other Direct Award",,12:00

Brief Description of Requirement
The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) is responsible for building national capacity for product safety to ultimately protect consumers from unsafe products and support compliant businesses. In addition to construction products, OPSS regulates a wide range of non-food and non-medicinal consumer products, all of which are listed here. The Teddington site houses OPSS testing facilities and is currently undergoing enhancement and development in a bid to strengthen national capability, support the enforcement of product safety and construction product casework and the investigation of new and emerging product risks. Chemical analysis is an important area for product testing, helping to determine the suitability and safety of materials and products for their intended applications. OPSS has recently procured analytical instrumentation including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Ultra High Performance-Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) and Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).
With OPSS becoming the regulator in construction products, the team's testing remit has greatly increased and there is a new focus on understanding the characteristics and performance of raw materials utilised in construction products. Raman Spectroscopy is identified as a suitable analytical technique, which would complement OPSS current testing capability in material characterisation in the Analytical Laboratory and provide additional insight particularly for construction products. The chemical mapping from Raman will provide a more in-depth chemical analysis of a material's structure and microscopic location of particles, which the FTIR is currently limited in what it can offer",,,"United Kingdom","38000000 ","Thomas Ellis",scientificresearch@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,,,,,,28/09/2022,31/10/2025,23/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,57956.58,,27/09/2022,53313.64,"[Thermo Fisher Scientific|Tudor Road

We use mass messaging techniques countywide but can also be specific to area or district. These messages communicate effectively across a wide area within a short timescale, ensuring there is consistency and enabling local education or training activity to benefit from the credibility of association with a bigger message. The campaigns are an annual programme that coincide with the National Policing Calendar, consequently our campaigns run alongside the issues the police are enforcing. An annual campaign calendar also ensures that we work collaboratively with our partner agencies on the same issues at the same time, ensuring consistent messaging across the county. Having a programme of campaigns throughout the year gives us the opportunity to continuously target specific road users and their behaviours. We are able, across the year, to target specific areas that occur highly in the crash stats and can not only target online audiences but also within town centres, radio, TV and pubs. 

All of our campaign creative has been developed, our requirement for this procurement exercise is for media buying, exclusively; if we require further development of creative, this would fall outside of this framework and procurement regulations apply. Most campaigns, dependent on the total cost of the campaign, undertake a pre and post and often midterm research exercise with a market research company; this helps us to understand where the campaigns are being well received and if the public are reacting in a positive way and their behaviours have changed. It is particularly reassuring when public behaviours and opinions have clearly changed, but if they have not, it can give us a clear indication of where we still need to campaign and increase our messaging.

      The University of Sheffield wishes to invite tenders for an autonomous, connected, mobile robot on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, IMG Group at Catcliffe, South Yorkshire.
      
      Scope of Requirement
      The AMRC IMG group has a requirement for an autonomous, connected, mobile robot which can traverse environments such as train depots or busy factories. The robotic solution will be a quadruped, owing to the increased versatility afforded by this architecture, and the interest expressed by the AMRC's partners in the use of this type of robot. It will be used on projects that work with both academia and industry to deliver cutting edge research into manufacturing robotics.
      The robot will act as a platform for investigations into the use of 5G in an industrial setting, in the context of mobile robots. It is therefore important that the system should arrive equipped with 5G functionality, such that research can be conducted into how best to employ the technology for a range of applications, including control, mapping, fleet management and condition monitoring
      The platform will be used for the development and testing of a large variety of use cases for novel applications. It is therefore important that the robot comes with communications interfaces, mounting points and a 24V power supply minimum.

This should include data relating specifically to emerging themes such as the fintech sector including uptake and usage of financial technology and associated tools, services, processes etc (including open banking). 

The reports and data we are looking for focus mainly on financial services, particularly the savings market and the UK, but not limited to that. Ideally trend data would be available on key areas such as market size and value (including forecasts). We also have an interest in global information. We are looking for access to data or reports that are being collated by the agency as a matter of their core business rather an agency which would provide bespoke reports or data that we would have to commission. 

NS&I would also be looking for analyst support to be provided within the subscription to help us pull together specific information or data from that which is available through the service. However, we understand that needs to be within reason and that some requests may be at additional cost. 
Access to the reports and data would ideally be through a portal that allows multiple users from across NS&I to have self-service access.

It comprises the former councils of Northampton Borough, Daventry District and South Northamptonshire as well as half of the former Northamptonshire County Council.
West Northamptonshire has a population of 405,000 and 178,000 households spread over 165 town and parish council areas.   We don't yet have a full year of audited waste statistics, but the headline figures for 2021/2 are likely to be in the region of:
•	47.6% of household waste recycled or composted
•	9.5 % of municipal waste landfilled
•	99,500 tonnes of household waste requiring treatment prior to disposal 
Due to ongoing contractual commitments, the waste collections are still run as three different waste collection services, operated from depots in Northampton, Daventry and Towcester.  One service is contracted out, one a Joint Venture and one an in-house service.  However, some harmonisation work has taken place in areas such as bins colours, bulky waste charge, charge for garden waste collection, materials collected for recycling and service level agreements for missed bins etc.  
The council runs five Household Waste Recycling Centres and one Reuse and Recycling Centre.  The HWRCs are services currently run on the council's behalf by North Northamptonshire Council under a hosting arrangement until the current contract expires in 2025.  
The council has 2 residual waste treatment and disposal contract with private waste management companies which expire in 2025.  
The council monitors and manages 4 closed landfill sites.

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire (the ""PCC"") and the Chief Constable of Cheshire (CC)are working on a project to implement a reliable and robust Digital Evidence ManagementSystem (DEMS) to support the investigative process and best evidence to support prosecutions.

The DEMS will provide capabilities and functionality currently unavailable to officers and investigators and represents an opportunity to modernise its end to end criminal justice process (from point of initial investigation through to positive justice outcome) and in doing so provide a range of business benefits. 

The DEMS should be capable of ingesting, processing and delivering playable digital media from multiple sources. The system should allow for simultaneous working with multiple users logging in, searching, accessing, media playback, editing and exporting of evidence in a highly reliable, auditable and timely manner. This functionality is required if the media has been grouped under one case with multiple users being able to access the case and work with the media simultaneously. 

It is important that PCC and CC are able to gather, review and action media quickly. The agreed service levels should be consistently maintained. 

The new system should have a proven and established ability to integrate with third party policing systems e.g. Records Management System, Command and Control, Digital Video Interview Recording and meet the Design Principles Digital Evidence Sharing Blueprint. 

The DEMs will provide a direct digital secure interface with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and other key recognised criminal justice practitioners for digital evidence sharing, significantly reducing the volume of manual activities and discs produced. This will lead to a reduction of risk to the Force (data breaches) and efficiency savings (reduced time spent burning and transporting discs).",,"CW7 2UA","Any region","48000000 48100000 48170000 48600000 48610000 48611000 48612000 48613000 48614000 48900000 72000000 ","Laura Edwards",laura.edwards@cheshire.pnn.police.uk,"Headquarters, Clemonds Hey, Oakmere Road,",,"Winsford, Cheshire","CW7 2UA",ENG,"'+44 1606363853",www.cheshire.police.uk,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=46598&B=BLUELIGHT https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/33132 ",,07/09/2022,06/09/2027,01/07/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,1300000,3000000,27/09/2022,1554728,"[NICE Systems UK Limited|NICE Systems UK Limited

The route will not only increase numbers to the site but having a singular route that is easy to follow will mean the ecology of the site can remain safe and grow back to what it was before.

The coastal path is a popular and heavily used route which stretches along the White Cliffs of Dover, used throughout the year by local walkers and visitors.  As a result, the surface has become significantly worn and damaged in places.  

The path traverses an area of ecological importance and historical significance, as well as being recognised for its landscape heritage. By carrying out sensitive repairs and improvements to the surface, it will maintain access across the cliffs which protects the ecology, allows safe an accessible passage and supports continued and longer-term tourism, as well as sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits. Furthermore, the improvements will facilitate and mitigate the expected increase in the number of people using the route, together with significantly reducing further damage to the landscape.  

Kent County Council (KCC) Public Rights of Way has received a grant from the Experience Project to construct a surfaced footpath along the White Cliffs of Dover from the Visitor Centre to the Lighthouse. By creating this route, we hope to boost tourism to the area as you will be able to easily walk along the cliffs for the entire year in all weathers. The site is always very busy so please be mindful that you will have to factor in how the public are managed when pricing for the works.

The Twelvetrees Lab work on understanding the molecular mechanisms or slow axonal transport so we can develop a deeper understanding of how this process supports neuronal function and longevity. The group uses a combination of biochemistry, cell biology and single molecule methods to probe transport mechanisms, through generous funding from a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society. The lab is based in the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience and collaborates with many groups in the building.

Our work studies how microtubule motor proteins interact differentially with a variety of cargo to regulate distinct rates of transport. Many of our experiments are built around fluorescence microscopy assays; we rely on self labelling enzymes (SNAPf, CLIPf and HaloTag) in combination with their fluorescent ligands (e.g. TMR, 647-SiR, JF549 etc) for single molecule imaging, and also use fluorescent protein markers (EGFP, mTurquoise2, mScarlet-I etc). We use two broad classes of assay system: 1. primary neuronal cultures for live cell imaging and; 2. in vitro motile systems reconstituted from purified proteins. Typical microscopy applications of the lab include, but are not limited to: live-cell imaging of primary neurons over time scales from minutes to hours; single-molecule imaging in live cells; single molecule imaging of in vitro reconstituted motile systems; FRET of single molecules in vitro and populations of molecules within cells; photoablation and activation; super resolution microscopy.

The University now requires a microscopy system to support the research in this area. In order to image live neurons and in vitro reconstituted systems, the system must be capable of a number of distinct microscopy applications, including but not limited to: single molecule TIRF microscopy, instantaneous FRAP and TIRF, live-cell imaging, FRET, DNA-PAINT, widefield fluorescence microscopy. To facilitate single molecule imaging in demanding conditions, the system must have an automated focus drift compensation system to maintain z-position. To preserve the activity and integrity of live neurons, the system will be housed in a temperature controlled enclosure that can be operated at a range of temperatures, from room temperature up to 37C. The system must be mounted on an anti-vibration table to minimise environmental vibrations interfering with imaging. Computer control of the system must facilitate both sub second time lapse imaging of single molecules as well as automated time lapse imaging of several points in the sample over many hours.",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","38510000 ","James Noble",james.noble@sheffield.ac.uk,"Western Bank",,SHEFFIELD,S102TN,England,,,,,,02/01/2023,03/01/2023,13/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Products,294868.87,,27/09/2022,294868.87,"[Cairn Research Ltd|Graveney Road

ABOUT THE FRC

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regulates auditors, accountants, and actuaries; and sets the UK's Corporate Governance and Stewardship Codes. We seek to promote transparency and integrity in business; our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company accounts, audit, and high-quality risk management. 
As the Competent Authority for audit in the UK, the FRC sets auditing and ethical standards, and monitors and enforces audit quality. The FRC will be transformed into a new regulator: the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA) in the future, following three independent reviews and recommendations, and the Government's 2021 consultation ""Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance""  and the Government's response to that consultation.

ABOUT THE RESEARCH PROJECT 

The aim of this research project is to further our understanding of how innovation and competition interact in the market for audit services. The FRC's strategic objectives for 2022-25 include promoting improvements and innovation in the areas for which we are responsible and creating a more resilient audit market through greater competition and choice.  The outputs of this research project will inform the FRC's work to drive up audit quality and improve the functioning of the audit market. 

The outputs that will be delivered by this research project (included but not limited to):
-	A short literature and (secondary) evidence review. This should include:
•	a summary of any research on the links between innovation and competition in the audit market. For this research project we are concerned predominantly with the audit market for FTSE 350 companies but would also be interested in innovation-competition dynamics in any other parts of the audit market for UK Public Interest Entities (PIEs) or in audit markets elsewhere in the world.
•	a summary of the latest research, both empirical and theoretical, on the interaction between innovation and competition at a more general level. This does not necessarily need to be audit specific providing findings could be of relevance to the audit market. 
•	a summary of the available (secondary) evidence on innovations in audit since the previous work by the Competition Commission referenced above. 
-	Informed by the literature review and the evidence identified above, a short discussion paper with questions for discussion at the workshop (see below) with relevant innovation and competition experts. 
-	A small-scale structured (online) workshop with relevant innovation and competition experts from academia and other institutions such as think tanks and regulators (including the FRC). 
-	A short, written report.

The Council made a Climate Emergency Declaration in February 2020, as part of this commitment, the council require their energy supply to be certified as 100% from traceable renewable sources where investment in developing renewable capacity is prioritised, and all energy is certified with traceable certification. We recognise that some organisations are working towards green gas and currently operate by offsetting production. Such supplies will be considered but will be expected to provide information about the percentage of the gas supplied is green gas, and their plans for investing in increasing green gas innovation. 

Yate Town Council require suppliers to disclose the mix of fuels (coal, gas, nuclear, renewable, and other) used to generate the energy supplied. If your supply is offset solely, or in part, by renewable energy certification, you should state this information, including the certification type, in your submission. 
If a company cannot certify its renewable supply, tenders will be considered, providing the company provides transparency in its energy sourcing and can demonstrate the extent to which it departs from these provisions and the steps it is taking to achieve zero carbon or net zero carbon energy production, to enable the evaluation of its green commitment.

Please find attached the following information to assist in providing your quotations:
•	Electric and Gas Annual Usage Spreadsheet from April 2021 - March 2022.

Network Rail delivered round 4.5 of its plan to ORR in Mar 22. This was the final top-down plan and Network Rail has now moved to round 5.0, the first stage of bottom-up planning.  ORR will not receive this plan, but wishes to gain confidence that risk and uncertainty is adequately considered as part of Network Rail plans and therefore wishes to commission a study into the methodology used within Network Rail to develop its P(50) plan.

Currently an Independent Reporter piece of work is being conducted into the use of unit rates within Network Rail, an overview is shown below. The output from the Independent Reporter, when combined with the outputs described in section 2.3 will provide ORR with a holistic view of risk inherent within Network Rail planning processes.
  
Independent reporter: How are unit cost rates calculated and used

Background: Unit rates, when combined with the volumes of work to be undertaken, provide the key costing information for the renewals plan.  Local and national rates often exist, their selection criteria is not always documented in Network Rail's Initial Business Plan (IBP) and their limitations / applicability need to be understood.

Why is this an issue: Unit rates are a key cost driver. Appropriate selection is imperative, national rates should be the composite average, as such, local rates, when combined should average out at the national rate. Should a more advantageous rate be selected for planning purposes additional (excessive) risk provision would be embedded in estimates.

Plan to address: Independent Reporter commissioned

What does ""good"" look like as an outcome for ORR: Clear understanding of the statistical significance of local / national unit rates and their applicability / selection criteria.  An understanding of the adherence to these criteria, allows a quantitative view of embedded risk.",,,"United Kingdom","79400000 ","Harriet Dinkele",procurementteam@orr.gov.uk,"25 Cabot Square",,London,E144QZ,England,02072823944,,"Bravosolution Joining Instruction for open tender.doc ORR CT 22-22 Disclaimer.doc ORR CT 22-22 Draft Form of Agreement.docx ORR CT 22-22 Form of Tender.doc ORR CT 22-22 Embedded Risk ITT  Statement of Requirement_.docx ",,"The tender exercise is being managed via the ORR Procurement portal (BRAVO).

The expert advice will support the Council in being able to understand the current as-is architecture currently provided by through a managed IT Service, and provide technical support to design a service and operating model that meets the being able to meet the needs of the Council moving forward. The resource will provide the continuity between the technical service provided by the managed service provider, during the service design and implementation phase, and handover to future strategic technical partners as well as the in-house capability which will have overall responsibility for the service. 

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT OF THE OPPORTUNITY
IT service provision is critical to the success of the services provided by Luton Council and to ensure there is a close alignment between the Council and its IT service provision, the Council believes it would be better to insource the service from its current managed service arrangement. This is also an opportunity to move the Council from an on premise solution to one where business systems are predominantly hosted in the Cloud.
IT needs to be seen to be and is a key service and performance enabler and how it can help the Council to modernise its approach to service delivery. The current set up has meant that for much of the Council, IT is currently seen as a barrier to success.

SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT 
The scope of requirements for this work are as follows:
1.	The identification of tactical improvements to the current architecture that can be reasonably delivered by the current managed service provider whilst the new service is designed and built. 
2.	A detailed technical architecture that is aligned to the Council's objectives and ambitions supported by clearly understood IT design principles. This includes moving from an on premise solution to the cloud. There is an understanding that some applications will always remain on premise and a hybrid model is expected. 
3.	An IT service design that is focussed more on customers and users empowering them to make better use of technology in the future.
4.	A future IT Operating Model which is based on best practice guidance (such as ITIL) but is tailored for success for Luton so the service is both more efficient and effective for the Council.
5.	Support to the existing BAU programmes to understand the impact of their proposed implementations and whether any re-phasing is required.
In order to get to the final service architecture and design it is expected that the supplier will work with the Council, and other expert advisors, produce the following documents to support the programme:
1.	A Vision Statement for the new IT Service incorporating IT service management, change delivery, architecture and design and contract and vendor management. 
2.

Work Required: 
The profiled metal roof sheets to the original masonry section have been ripped off due to high winds.
The missing roof sheets will require replacement with a modern equivalent, similar to that installed to the steel framed section. The existing timber joists could be retained but these should be checked to ensure they are securely fixed. 
Minor repairs are required to the cracked / damaged section of blockwork. Loose sections require removal and replacement with new blockwork. In addition, the gutters and facias require clearing and checking that they are securely fixed.

* In addition to having the roof repairs completed, the gutters currently require clearing throughout the depot. If you wish to include this in your tender, please itemise this additional work separately.

Building details: 
The building consists of a single storey open fronted shelter, primarily used for the storage of sand, and other materials and equipment. The building is of loadbearing masonry block construction with a timber framed roof covered with profiled metal sheeting. The front of the building has been extended via a modern steel framed structure to provide additional sheltered storage space. The steel framed extension abuts the original section and is also covered with profiled metal roof sheeting.

The audience will include schools, community, and health care settings.

Wigan Council has been awarded a DEFRA Grant to develop and deliver an information campaign to raise awareness of air pollution and promote behaviour change amongst residents, children and their parents. The aim is to reduce their exposure to air pollution and to increase levels of active travel within the borough.

The project has two strands:

• Firstly, to develop and produce materials/resources for education campaigns to be delivered in schools (appropriate for KS3 and 4) and in community settings. The campaigns will be delivered by an Education Officer appointed by Wigan Council, and the teachers.

• The second strand is to develop an information / educational campaign targeted primarily at the community and healthcare settings to improve their knowledge and awareness of air quality issues, how to decrease exposure to air pollution and lower their own emissions using simple behaviour change approaches.

The successful bidder will act as a facilitator and will work on a range of community-based projects. The work will vary and will require careful planning in liaison with Devon County Council's Emergency Tree Fund Team. There are several elements to this work, accompanied with various requirements. The project will be funded through Devon County Council's Emergency Tree Fund. The successful bidder will act as a grantee and will receive an initial payment to cover the basic package of planting projects formerly identified by the Emergency Tree Fund Team. This package of work is subject to extension depending on the contractor's agreed commitment to the overall project. This document will provide opportunity to provide an indication of service costs based on the sites presently identified. The agreement will provide flexibility as the intention is to identify additional sites as the project develops; this means there may also be scope to identify additional tasks, which may be subject to a specified day rate. The number of days appropriate to allocate to project development of additional sites will be subject to agreement in advance of award of the contract. It is important to note that further tree stock provided for additional sites will be subject to a demonstration of best value for money.  
Main body of work: 
•	Planning and development of volunteer planting events 
•	Purchase of tree and planting accessories  
•	Liaison with project partners  
•	Project promotion to community 
•	Publicity and media communications 
•	Coordination and supervision of on-site planting 
•	Follow up maintenance over 5 years, including replacement trees

•	Build good relationships with Woodland Trust approved tree nurseries and reserve stock for future planting projects 
•	Identify additional sites for planting (public land) 
•	Support the development of agreements between Devon County Council and prospective project partners   
Project Specific Requirements: 
•	Schemes must be primarily whip-based; standard planting (individual trees) and hedgerow planting is only acceptable if it is additional to whip planting. 
•	Schemes must engage with community groups and all planting events should be supported by volunteers 
•	Events must provide PL insurance and risk assessments  
Deliverables: 
•	County-wide community engagement is an important deliverable. Schemes must be representative of the county and not bias to one district.  
•	Schemes must support the wider Emergency Tree Fund planting targets; we expect to plant at least 6600 trees through this project proposal & contract 
•	Schemes must support a variety of planting approaches (e.g. urban, rural, public greenspace etc) 
•	Schemes must support the promotion of the Emergency Tree Fund.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regulates auditors, accountants and actuaries and sets the UK's Corporate Governance and Stewardship Codes. We seek to promote transparency and integrity in business; our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company accounts, audit, and high-quality risk management.

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is growing in actuarial modelling. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), the UK's professional association for actuaries, has been encouraging education and training in these techniques among its members and recently launched a data science certification

The objective of this research is to learn more about the role of AI/ML in UK actuarial modelling practices across pensions, life insurance, general insurance, and wider fields (e.g., banking and investment). It will also compare the extent of AI/ML deployment by the actuarial profession with that of other similar professions. The overall purpose of the research is to improve our understanding of new risks that AI/ML might bring to the quality of actuarial work. To do this, the research will address the following four areas of enquiry: 

1.	Areas of use: Which actuarial departments are involved in using AI and ML techniques in their work? 
2.	Approach: What approach(es) and technique(s) are used? How are they selected? 
3.	Governance: What is the governance process around the use of AI and ML techniques as compared to the governance process around the more traditional techniques?
4.	Output: How do the areas of use, approach and governance of AI and ML impact on
a.	the way outputs are used internally by a company, and
b.	the uncertainty around the actuarial modelling results using AI/ML, as compared to the uncertainty around results from the more traditional approaches?
