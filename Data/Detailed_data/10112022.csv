In brief, Natural England are seeking potential contractors to undertake a strategic review of Chichester Harbour, looking at how the existing public and privately owned assets (sea walls) and coastal management options are impacting the condition of the SSSI. This review should also seek to identify opportunities to remove the barriers to coastal change, as identified in the Condition Review. This will help build the evidence that we need to influence the change of Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) policy and to identify opportunities to restore the site to favourable condition as part of the wider Nature Recovery Network.

This review will use recent studies to identify smaller sites (complementing the larger-scale and longer term managed realignment options being delivered through the Regional Habitat Compensation Programme Regional Habitat Compensation Programme - Coastal Partners) where decommissioning of existing defences, relocation of footpaths and areas of un-defended land could be managed for nature recovery.",,,"South East","79314000 ","Kate Bull",kate.bull@naturalengland.org.uk,"Guildbourne House","Chatsworth Road",Worthing,"BN11 1LD",England,,,"Strategic approach to management of seawalls around Chichester Harbour _specification document Final.docx ",,"Quotations are requested to provide information required in the RFQ.

We have a great opportunity to shape and influence how SCS could be used for species conservation planning. These strategies could potentially be used in a more ambitious way and Natural England and key stakeholders agree they must be holistic and dynamic. Identifying all the conservation actions needed, joined up with other key environmental initiatives and policies (such as Local Nature Recovery Strategies - LNRS, the Environmental Land Management System - ELMS, and Biodiversity Net Gain - BNG), and adaptive so that they can be implemented to best effect to help recover species.

The purpose of this contract is to help facilitate thinking within Natural England and Defra about the future use of SCS by bringing together expert staff through a series of internal workshop sessions to be held during autumn/winter 2022/23.

The aim of the workshops is to help us to think broadly and ambitiously about the possibilities for using SCS to recover nature, how SCS could be used in practice, where we should focus our efforts, and what sort of system is needed to prioritise whether a species warrants an SCS.

The outputs from the workshops will be used to help inform:

•	Further engagement activity with external stakeholders and partners about SCS.
•	A discussion paper (for Natural England Senior Leaders and Defra) proposing future direction for SCS and next steps.
•	Development of a framework to help guide decisions about when an SCS is needed. 

We anticipate holding three workshops, with up to 20-25 people at each session. Locations to be confirmed but likely to be Peterborough, London or Bristol (or a combination). The requirement is for a contractor to design and facilitate these workshops and capture the outputs in a narrative report. An environmental background with experience of IUCN Conservation Planning methods and approaches would be advantageous, although not essential.",,,England,"79421200 ","Philippa Richards",philippa.richards@naturalengland.org.uk,"Ground Floor, Sterling House","Dix's Field",Exeter,"EX1 1QA",England,,,"Request for Quotation SCS workshops October 2022.docx ",,"Prices must be submitted in £ sterling, inclusive of VAT.

ANI010,Contract,"Natural England",Awarded,2023-03-03T13:12:06Z,"Assessing nutrient impacts on lakes from birds","When looking at the various nutrient inputs to lakes, bird faeces are often cited as a conspicuous source of nutrients, and a potential reason for not reaching favourable condition on SSSIs lakes that are designated for their lake-habitat interest.  We don't currently know the nutrient loads from birds at SSSI lakes or how significant a source of nutrients this is. 

This project aims to produce a tool to calculate the nutrient inputs to SSSI lakes from birds. The aim is to be able to use WEBS and other available bird data, in conjunction with known  concentrations of nutrients in faeces from different bird species (the contractor will need to find this information from the literature), to calculate nutrient (Total N & P) loads in kg/ha from birds for all the lake-habitat SSSIs (a list of these will be supplied). The relative importance of the nutrient contribution from the birds at each site also needs to be understood. 

As many SSSI lakes are currently not reaching their nutrient targets this needs to be understood from two perspectives.

1)	The proportion of the current total nutrient load, which is calculated as coming from the current bird populations

2)	The proportion of the total nutrient load, which would be low enough for the lakes to reach their nutrient targets, which is calculated as coming from the current bird populations.  

The Outputs from the project will be:

•	Outputs calculated for 161 individual SSSI lakes designated for lake habitat (subject to bird data being available from WEBS or other data sources). This can be presented as an excel tool populated with individual lake parameters and outputs. In which case there should be an excel output for each lake.

•	A report explaining the methodology used to calculate the nutrient contributions, a guide to using the tool and main findings about the contribution of birds to lake nutrient concentration in English SSSIs.

•	The tool must be designed so that it can be easily updated with new data on bird species and abundance  utilising a particular (SSSI) lake. 

•	The priority application for this tool is to determine impact on SSSI lakes. However, it should be designed so that it could be easily used for other non-designated site lakes (subject to supporting data being available) 

•	The tool should be able to run independently on a laptop, using standard Microsoft products (ideally Excel) so it can be easily used and shared across Natural England and with other colleagues.

•	The user-interface should be easy to use, with a simple guide to accompany the tool.

•	One recorded teams call where the tool will be demonstrated, so it can be used as a future training resource.

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the CCS Research and Insights DPS.

Brief Description of Requirement

BEIS are commissioning a process evaluation of the regulations, to understand how well they have been implemented and how industry and consumers have responded to their implementation. This will inform further policy development on smart charging and provide lessons learned for wider policy development. This includes measures on smart secure energy systems, smart heating appliances, and energy smart appliances currently recently introduced into Parliament through the Energy Security Bill.  
The aims of the project are as follows:
1.	Understand how the chargepoint industry in Great Britain has responded to the implementation of the regulations, and any first-year developments.
2.	Understand if the regulations will support opportunities for wider industry (charge point manufacturers, retailers, energy suppliers, technology providers etc.)
3.	Understand how the device standards have been adopted by industry and what this may mean for consumer choice and experience.
4.	Provide insight into the barriers, enablers and incentives for smart charging.
5.	Review the policy process and develop lessons learnt for future policy making 
To meet the project aims outlined above, the project can be broken down into two parts:
1.	Industry Research 
-	Developing a stakeholder system map of the private charging market and assessing how different stakeholders interact with each other and are affected by the regulations
-	Developing a consumer journey map presenting the steps consumers can take to purchase a chargepoint (from information gathering, to point of purchase and use of chargepoint)
-	Assessment of the products available in the private chargepoint market 
-	Qualitative and quantitative research with different industry groups to understand how they have been affected by the regulations 
2.	Consumer Research 
-	Qualitative research with EV drivers to understand their consumer journey experience and explore if and how different types of consumers respond to incentives 
To inform the research, the successful bidder can carry out informal interviews with policy officials in BEIS. The successful bidder can gather information on the following to fully understand the background of the regulations:
-	Rationale and objectives for the development of the regulations 
-	Challenges and risks with development or implementation of the regulations 
-	Potential future policy or regulation changes",,,"Any region","79300000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,,,,01/11/2022,31/05/2023,05/10/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,143489,,08/11/2022,143489,"[RICARDO-AEA LIMITED|UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,01/11/2022,31/05/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,14:00

each purchase a dedicated electron diffractometer for high-throughput structural
solution (two diffractometers in total) using Electron Diffraction. These
instruments will form part of a national facility in conjunction with the national
crystallographic service at Southampton. This procurement will be funded under an
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant with the aim of
kickstarting the widespread usage of electron diffraction by the crystallographic
community within the UK. 
The instruments will sit alongside and integrate with our existing and extensive XRay diffraction facilities. To that end the instruments must be suitable for use by
non-specialist microscopists and should allow for the high-throughput collection of
data for structural solution. Equally, the software must also be easy to use and
allow for merging of datasets from multiple crystals to ensure sufficient
completeness for publication.
Alongside the national aspect, there will be local users from both universities
spanning a large range of different areas of materials research. There will also be
technique development, with regards to optimised sample preparation, new classes
of materials, but also on areas such as improving the refinements, e.g., dynamical
diffraction. It is hoped to work with the successful supplier to develop this for the
good of the whole community.
This tender is being run as a further competition against the NWUPC High Value
Laboratory Equipment Lot 10 Polycrystalline & Single Crystal X-Ray Analysis
(LAB3123 NW)
With reference to the joint procurement, the University of Southampton will be
responsible for running the Further Competition process via its e-tendering portal,
receiving and responding to general project correspondence and clarification
requests, receiving the Further Competition responses, co-ordinating and
facilitating the tender evaluation and moderation and awarding the eventual
contract. Following formal contract award, the two institutions will be responsible
for forming their own contracts. 
The successful supplier will be contracting with two separate institutions, the
University of Southampton and the University of Warwick. Each institution will have
its own contract with the successful supplier, will stipulate separate delivery and
installation locations and instructions, will require separate invoices and will raise
separate purchase orders. 
The final award of this contract will be subject to funding being approved, if the
funds are not approved, we reserve the right to not award a contract as a result of

In relation to this dispatch aspect, including recording of arrival times for KPI purposes, the services of Twilio are required.

Twilio, who are the only supplier available due to their interoperability with Service Manager, provide text messaging relay services which will be used to task Care Connect responders, send incident information, and record response times and other real time status updates.

The annual cost of the Twilio service will be solely dependent on the level of use, which itself is dependent on incidents attended by the Care Connect Service. Twilio text messaging relay services will be required, and charged, each time an incident is attended by Care Connect Responders. The estimated cost for the initial 12-month period, based on anticipated use, is £6,569 - quote attached. Whilst this is high level estimate, it may be prudent to include a maximum spend of £10,000 to give additional flexibility with the contract.

This contract will be required for as long as the Care Connect Service uses the Service Manager product. As such, for ease of process it would ideally be given an initial rolling duration of 3 years, albeit use is on an as-required basis as outlined above.

The wider Service Manager project was part of a capital funding scheme, although as an ongoing and unforeseen cost, Twilio, will be met through standard revenue spend.

These instruments will form part of a national facility in conjunction with the national crystallographic service at Southampton. This procurement will be funded under an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant with the aim of kickstarting the widespread usage of electron diffraction by the crystallographic community within the UK. 
The instruments will sit alongside and integrate with our existing and extensive X-Ray diffraction facilities. To that end the instruments must be suitable for use by non-specialist microscopists and should allow for the high-throughput collection of data for structural solution. Equally, the software must also be easy to use and allow for merging of datasets from multiple crystals to ensure sufficient completeness for publication.
Alongside the national aspect, there will be local users from both universities spanning a large range of different areas of materials research. There will also be technique development, with regards to optimised sample preparation, new classes of materials, but also on areas such as improving the refinements, e.g., dynamical diffraction. It is hoped to work with the successful  supplier to develop this for the good of the whole community.

This tender is being run as a further competition against the NWUPC High Value Laboratory Equipment Lot 10 Polycrystalline & Single Crystal X-Ray Analysis (LAB3123 NW).

With reference to the joint procurement, the University of Southampton will be responsible for running the Further Competition process via its e-tendering portal, receiving and responding to general project correspondence and clarification requests, receiving the Further Competition responses, co-ordinating and facilitating the tender evaluation and moderation and awarding the eventual contract. Following formal contract award, the two institutions will be responsible for forming their own contracts. 
The successful supplier will be contracting with two separate institutions, the University of Southampton and the University of Warwick. Each institution will have its own contract with the successful supplier, will stipulate separate delivery and installation locations and instructions, will require separate invoices and will raise separate purchase orders. 
The final award of this contract will be subject to funding being approved, if the funds are not approved, we reserve the right to not award a contract as a result of this Further Competition process.",,"SO17 1BJ",,"38530000 ","Kayleigh Luckins",Procurement@soton.ac.uk,"BUILDING 37, HIGHFIELD CAMPUS,UNIVERSITY ROAD",,SOUTHAMPTON,SO171BJ,England,"02380 595000",https://www.southampton.ac.uk/,,,,14/12/2022,30/11/2033,07/10/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Products,1259786,,04/11/2022,1259786,"[Rigaku Europe SE|Hugenottenallee 167

The project will help us understand the key risks and its impacts in the long term and inform how we can adapt to climate and land use change impacts on groundwater quality.
This is the second phase of this project, following the initial scoping study.
In the first phase we highlighted how currently there is an international focus on climate change impacts and the need to adapt, shown with the organisation of COP26 last year. The Environment Agency's adaptation report makes the urgent case for taking strong action now, because the reality is that significant climate impacts are inevitable despite all the measures that are in place. It is important that we optimise the regulatory tools available for managing and protecting groundwater quality (Environment Agency, 2021b).
For this phase of the project, we aim to develop datasets and tools that can be used for decision making around climate change and groundwater quality. We also aim at looking into new and improved ways to engage with the public to bring a better understanding about groundwater.",,,"Any region","72220000 ",,procurement@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,'+443001234500,www.defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Project_37470_Award Letter_Impacts of climate change and land use on groundwater quality - Phase 2_Redacted_Contract.xlsx.pdf ",,,09/11/2022,31/03/2023,13/10/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,,08/11/2022,77222.94,"[British Geological Survey|Environmental Science Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham, NG12 5GG|NONE_PARTNERSHIP||Yes|No]",,09/11/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,12:00

Please note: NHS England and Improvement have announced that the Sussex Health and Care Partnership, which is made up of all health and care organisations across East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove, has successfully met the criteria to become an Integrated Care System (ICS). An ICS is a way of working across health and care organisations that allows them to work closer together, to take collective responsibility of the health and wellbeing of populations across large areas.
It is not anticipated that the statutory responsibility or accountability of the individual health and care organisations working as an ICS will be affected, save for the expectation that CCG organisations will be abolished and functions transferred to the ICS. As a result of these intended healthcare reforms, the Contracting Authority, currently NHS East Sussex CCG, may change during the life of the contract.",,,"South East","85000000 ","Andrew Elliott",aelliott1@nhs.net,"Sackville House, Brooks Close",,Lewes,"BN7 2FZ",England,07823533520,https://www.eastsussexccg.nhs.uk/,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/soepscommissioning/aspx/Home ","The service will offer the following:

The research will be a key part of OPSS' evidence on online marketplace and addresses a 
gap that has been identified. 
By understanding the extent to which different messages impact consumers, it will help 
OPSS to develop the strategy on online marketplaces and consumer-focused campaigns. 
The project will run across two phases. The first phase will interview consumers as they 
re-enact a recent purchase via an online marketplace. This qualitative phase will provide 
an understanding of how consumers shop using online marketplaces - what information 
do they look for / notice, and how aware are they of the origins of the product. 
The second phase of the research will develop some of the themes from the first phase 
into a set of questions to test prevalence on a wider, quantitative scale. In addition to the 
short survey, there will be an experimental element, with the development and testing of 
different messages to measure any reported impact these messages have with potential 
consumers.",,"SW1H 0ET",,"73000000 ","Deborah Banner",FMProcurement@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,"01793 867520",,,,,10/11/2022,31/03/2023,12/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,154155,,07/11/2022,154155,"[Kantar Public UK Ltd|4 Millbank, London, SW1P 3JA|COMPANIES_HOUSE|13663077|Yes|No]",,10/11/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,11:00

Adverts were placed on Contracts Finder and the Find a Tender Service and an Open procedure was undertaken in July 2022. No bids were received. 

Vinney Green Secure Children's Home (SCH) is based in South Gloucestershire and accommodates up to 24 children and young people (CYP) of both sexes, aged between 10 and 17, at any one time. The population is transient (short average length of stay), dynamic (high rates of turnover), heterogeneous (varied reasons for referral and unique circumstances) and is drawn from a large population (CYP can be referred from anywhere in the United Kingdom). 

The home is licensed for operation by OFSTED and it contracts with the Youth Custody Service to provide placements for young people. It is subject to regular inspection by a range of government and local authority approved officials, to ensure the highest standards are maintained at all times. The home is managed by South Gloucestershire Council's Department for Children, Adults and Health. 
  
Length of stay in the Home is highly variable and some young people will start sentences that will see them transition to adult custodial settings. 

NHS England is responsible for commissioning all health services in the Home and for the clinical governance of the services provided. 

The healthcare services provision will include:
•	General Medical Services
•	Mental Health Services
•	Primary Care Nursing
•	Public Health Programmes
•	Emotional Wellbeing services 
•	Contraception and sexual health advice services
•	Substance misuse services - Psychosocial and pathways to clinical treatment.
•	Screening and immunisation
•	Diagnostic services
•	Smoking Cessation Services
•	Management of long-term conditions
•	Health promotion and prevention

The service will facilitate access to community based secondary care services, including dentistry and optometry.

It is vital that there is continuity of provision for these services and, as there are no concerns with the quality or value for money of the current service, the Commissioner has taken the decision to re-award the contract to Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership Trust, the incumbent provider. 

The contract term will be for 7 years, with a total contract value of £5,875,000.00. 

The new contract is due to commence on 1st April 2023.

A Prior Information Notice was also published in May 2022 to which limited expressions of interest were received. Providers who had expressed interest were signposted to the opportunity once published. No bids were received. 

The Commissioner is awarding the contract under regulation 32(2)(a) of the Public Contracts Regulations.

The service specification and requirements of contract remain as published within the tender documentation and thus the contract has not been substantially altered.

The services are healthcare services falling within Schedule 3 to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (""the Regulations""), which are not subject to the full regime of the Regulations, but are instead governed by the ""Light Touch Regime"" contained within Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Regulations (Regulations 74 to 77).",01/04/2023,31/03/2030,21/12/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,5875000,,08/11/2022,5875000,"[Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership - N H S Trust|Bath Nhs House,Combe Park

This will be based on topic knowledge, user requirements, cognitive testing with key participant groups, and engagement with topic experts and stakeholders. 
      
      The requirement is defined as two questionnaires as it is essential prevalence estimates are produced for children aged 11 to 17 years and adults aged 18 to 25 years. However, we recognise there may be variations in the questionnaire across ages within these groups, such as the questions and survey text. Alongside this, an appropriate safeguarding procedure should be designed which successfully contributes to ensuring the participants are safe from others who may put them at significant risk of harm. 
      
      ONS will be establishing a steering group to ensure stakeholders and key topic experts are consulted in the design and approach. The terms of reference for the group will be designed by ONS and the chair and secretariat (for example, hosting and minute taking) will also be provided by ONS. It is desirable that the supplier will be able to help recruit for the group based on their connections with experts in the field and collaborate with ONS in using this group to ensure a successful outcome for the project. Potential suppliers are encouraged to set out their ability to do so in their bid. 
      
      The research has been split into two parts, A, and B. Although they focus on different aspects, the two parts of research are not independent of each other as they will need to be approached simultaneously to ensure the survey questions provide information needed for appropriate safeguarding to be administered. 
      
      For part A, two final questionnaires should be provided that have undergone cognitive testing with key participant groups. The final deliverable includes a report detailing the: 
      -text within the survey, such as the introduction to the survey and topics (which may vary by age)  
      -questions (which may vary by age)  
      -question ordering and routing (which may vary by age)  
      -survey length  
      -adaptations to include those with SEND  
      -derivations needed between questions to produce the required prevalence estimates  
      
      For part B, a safeguarding procedure should be provided in relation to part A. The final deliverable includes a report outlining the safeguarding procedure detailing: 
      -any variations in its application across the devolved nations and encompassing regions  
      -any variations in its application across the different modes and ages  
      -the risks associated with the procedures   
      -operational requirements for its implementation  
      
      For both parts (A and B), the final report should also include:

this contract can be awarded using the negotiated procedure without prior
publication of a contract notice pursuant to Public Contracts Regulations 2015
(Article 32(2)(b)(ii)) for technical reasons. This is because Ultra Electronics Ltd
sonobuoys are required for technical reasons and interoperability, as the existing
systems have been provided by Ultras Electronics Ltd. Ultra Electronics Ltd
represents the UK on the NATO NIAG SG90 Sonobuoy Digital Telemetry panel.
These factors and their understanding of technology arising from the previous R&D
contracts associated with the sonobuoy project within the Underwater Systems
research programme all factor into the technical and interoperability justification.
Ultra Electronics Ltd have also been awarded a contract by DE&S for a through life
sonobuoys contract for RN and RAF. While this is a separate requirement with R&D
elements, interoperability is key and the sonobuoys tested must be Ultra to ensure
technical compatibility in the information gathered in the testing phase with both
the NATO panel and the DE&S sonobuoy contract. Only Ultra Electronics Ltd have

      On top of the economic benefits the UK screen sector is considered one of the most established and influential cinema and television content-makers in the world. Beyond cultural impact, the quality of British filmmaking, TV production and animation and narrative games are globally recognised, UK audio-visual schools are highly regarded worldwide, and the nationally produced visual effect industry often leads the way in innovation. 
      
      Despite this, the independent screen sector faces a number of challenges, as identified by the BFI's recent Economic Review of UK Independent Film . In this report, the UK Global Screen Fund was identified as one of the existing interventions designed to address the downward trend in independent film activity and support the sector to find new markets for UK content.
      The UK Global Screen Fund (UKGSF) was established as a 1-year pilot fund in 2021-22
      
      We would like to commission an evaluation of the pilot year of the UKGSF. The evaluation should assess the impacts of the UKGSF in its first year of operation, and also the processes around its implementation. 
      We expect the evaluation in the pilot year of the UKGSF to cover three distinct elements  process evaluation, impact evaluation and  economic evaluation.",,"W1T 1LN","Any region","79400000 79419000 ","Graham Bellas",graham.bellas@bfi.org.uk,"21 Stephen Street",London,London,"W1T 1LN","United Kingdom","0207 173 3299",,,,,14/11/2022,30/06/2023,26/10/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,60000,09/11/2022,55875,"[Burns Owens Partnership Ltd|Henry Wood House, 2 Riding House Street, London, United Kingdom, W1W 7FA|NONE||No|No]",,14/11/2022,30/06/2023,"Open ",,12:00

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the CCS Framework Research & Insights DPS RM6126

Brief Description of Requirement
Background

The UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) Board are committed to collecting evidence to understand the impacts of the Faraday Battery Challenge. Bidders are invited to bid for an evaluation of the Programme to gain insight into the outcomes and impact of phase two of the programme. An independent evaluation of phase one is currently underway.

Aims and Objectives of the Project

UKRI is seeking to commission an independent impact evaluation of the Faraday Battery Challenge Phase 2 with the aim to understand the extent to which FBC2 is continuing to make an impact, taking into account its original goals and building on the work undertaken during Phase 1. The evaluation needs to test the extent to which the programme will deliver the outcomes and impact as expected and outlined in the delivery plan and the extent to which these are attributable to programme funding. As well as interim outcomes, appointed evaluators should have a key role in defining evaluation scope and identifying impacts that can be realised within the Challenge Lifecyle. It is expected that the evaluation will consider each strand of the programme in detail, as well as the overall impact of the combined programme.",,,"United Kingdom","79300000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,"01793 867465",,,,,31/10/2022,31/10/2025,26/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,300000,,09/11/2022,291817,"[FRONTIER ECONOMICS LIMITED|Mid City Place,71 High Holborn

"Destinations 21/2021",Contract,".East Riding Of Yorkshire Council",Awarded,2021-11-04T08:11:15Z,"South Cliff Health and Wellbeing Scoping","2.1.1	South Cliff Caravan Park is the most valuable asset the Council holds in terms of net income generation.  The 2018/19 financial outturn provided a surplus of £1.925m. This has shown a steady increase year on year and continues to do so. It is anticipated that the net surplus for 2020/2021 financial year will be £3.225m.
The park currently comprises the following: 
•	862 permanent static caravan pitches 
•	208 touring pitches 
•	51 tent pitches 
•	40 fleet hire caravans and lodges for holiday lettings 
•	Two shower blocks, reception and Facility Manager's office 
•	Four properties with ground leases to third parties - Makis Leisure Centre, South Cliff Takeaway, South Cliff Supermarket and South Cliff Caravan Sales.

The current occupancy levels achieved are: 
Permanent Static Pitches                    	90%
Touring Pitches 	75%
Tenting 	75%
Fleet Hire 	90%





Occupancy levels are high and the site now suffers from limited the opportunities for increasing income further. During popular times of the year some pitches could be sold numerous times.

The site is dissected by a road, Pioneer Road, which runs through the two halves of the park. On the southern side of the park is a newly developed area which houses the majority of our holiday customers and was opened in May 2019. The existing side of the park is caravan owner based with no holiday lets on that area.  

2.1.2 	South Cliff also operates the Bridlington Park and Ride scheme which is situated on Wilsthorpe car park at the top of Pioneer Road, Bridlington, YO15 3QN. This scheme runs from Easter each year through to the end of October, at which point the facility closes for the winter. 

2.2	Requirements 

2.2.1	To consider viable options for high quality commercial opportunities that can make positive revenue contributions and would enhance the Council's Leisure and Tourism offer. 
2.2.2	To explore a health and wellbeing orientated facilities offer to enhance physical activity and / or healthy outcomes. 
2.2.3	To explore the potential of expansion to the current offer (both holiday and ownership) at South Cliff Holiday Park, utilising the land available.
2.2.4	To consult with relevant stakeholders and customers to ascertain their views and opinions as part of the process, at relevant stages. 


2.3	Required Outputs
2.3.1	To fully appraise current service and future delivery options
2.3.2	To engage with relevant stakeholders and customers to inform decisions.
2.3.3	To establish client / stakeholder meetings at regular intervals during the process. 
2.3.4	To propose a draft multi phase project to enable a fully informed decision making process but also to establish current position of the service and provide accurate information on external challenges to the business. 
2.3.5	To present a clear business plan for each phase of the project and present findings to key stakeholders.",,"YO15 3QN",,"73000000 ","Alex Crutchley",alex.crutchley@eastriding.gov.uk,"Cross Street",,BEVERLEY,HU179BA,England,01262671051,www.eastriding.gov.uk,,,,03/01/2022,31/05/2022,31/10/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,31500,,04/11/2022,31500,"[Association of Public Service Excellence|3rd floor Trafford House
