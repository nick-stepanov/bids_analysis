The Office for National Statistics (Contracting Authority) is the UK's largest independent producer of official statistics and is recognised as a national statistical institute (NSI).  It is responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population, and society at national, regional, and local levels. It also conducts the Census for England and Wales every 10 years.

Its main responsibilities are:

•	the collection, compilation, analysis, and dissemination of a range of key economic, social, and demographic statistics about the UK
•	the provision of statistical leadership and methodological advice for the benefit of UK official statistics and
•	representation of the UK internationally as the NSI. 
In order to collect data for the above purposes, surveys are carried out throughout the year and maintaining an accurate database of participants, such as the Statistical Business Register (SBR), is key to doing that successfully.

The main objective of this tender exercise is to engage a supplier to develop and deliver a new Statistical Business Register (SBR) by March 2023. The expected outcomes are:

•	To replace parts of an ageing legacy solution (IDBR - Inter-Departmental Business Register), which constrains the business in reacting to new requirements
•	To provide an improved service to both internal and external users of the existing Business Register (IDBR) by providing a more flexible, self-serve product.",,,"United Kingdom","48600000 48900000 72000000 73000000 ",,john.marchrones@ons.gov.uk,"Government Buildings,Cardiff Road",,NEWPORT,NP108XG,Wales,"01633 456167",,,"https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/16546 ",,19/04/2022,18/04/2024,17/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,3800000,23/03/2022,3800000,"[CGI IT UK LTD|51-53 Great Marlborough Street

Following an initial scoping exercise covering staff and students there is evidently demand for EV charging in small amounts at every site however clearly there is greatest demand at the main Hubs for Higher Education teaching at Kedleston Road and other Derby City sites.

To demonstrate commitment to low and zero emission vehicles the University intends to install charging points to the majority of Academic, Commercial & Residential properties under it's control over the next 3 years in a phased manner.

In addition to controlled-access 'public' charging proposed, the University operates it's own fleet of maintenance vehicles which are shortly to be exchanged for wholly electrified vans and a small fleet of pool cars which will be exchanged for electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the next 12 months.

The location priority list given in the following section identifies the preferred order of installation along with pertinent site-specific information to assist production of a quotation. Individual system design & installation will be the responsibility of the supplier who shall demonstrate suitable skills & experience in this field as part of the procurement process.

Equipment requirements & Tariff management requirements are outline at this stage and may be subject to variation as part of consultancy advice to be provided as part of the system design. 

Existing site and building information is available, however this is to differing standards and the supplier is to allow for time whilst further detailed information is sought either by the University or as part of any",,,"East Midlands","98351100 ","Procurement Team",procurement@derby.ac.uk,"71 BRIDGE STREET",,DERBY,DE13LB,England,"01332 591094",,,,,28/11/2022,28/11/2023,18/02/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,138348,,23/03/2022,138348,"[EB CHARGING LTD|Unit 1,Beech House, Beech Industrial Centre, Porters Wood

Further information on the scheme can be found here https://www.gov.uk/vaccine-damage-payment/eligibility

The services required are for Medical Assessments of the evidence being presented by applicants making a claim under the VDPS. An 'Assessment' is the end-to-end process to assess causation and level of disablement against the medical evidence presented in relation to a Claimant's health condition and/or disability.

The Supplier is required to undertake all appropriate action to complete the assessment. This may include gathering evidence from the most appropriate source/reference/expert/specialist to ensure a definitive view can be provided.

Historically, the average number of annual assessments is c100 however volumes have increased following the addition of Covid and Adult Flu vaccinations to the VDPS. There is no minimum (or maximum) commitment to the number of assessments that will be required under the contract as the scheme is demand driven. It is estimated that in year one of the contract there will be c1500-1800 claims that will require assessment within the first year of the contract. It is estimated that after year 1 of the contract the number of assessments will between 100-1000 assessments will be required per annum.

The estimated value of the contract set out here in and in the Contract Notice (FTS reference 2021/S 000-028514) was 6000000GBP ex VAT.  This estimate could be affected by the variable volume of assessments required over the term of the Contract and the value could therefore be more or less that the amount stated.

approach in primary care to caring for people living with chronic pain. This approach will
include screening, GP consultation and support from a mental health practitioner and the
voluntary care sector. Chronic pain is one of the most common long-term conditions in
England, as well as locally in Lambeth. Research suggests that chronic pain is more prevalent
among people with Black backgrounds. There are also a range of factors that contribute to
inequalities of patient experience, access and health outcomes for this population. Effort will
go into outreach and engagement with people from Black communities to co-develop the
approach. Programme development will start in late 2021, with an aim to start using the digital

The panel will enable the GDC to  involve and engage public and patients in a range of co-productive research and policy work.

The contract will run for 2 years from April 2022.

The overarching aims for the panel are: 

-	to provide access to a group or groups of patients and the public, some of whose knowledge and understanding of GDC and dental regulation develops over time; 

-	to ensure we reflect and harness the input of public and patients in as much of our work as is possible; and 

-	to provide a flexible, responsive and cost-effective method for GDC to engage patient and public in our work.

There are three main objectives for public and patient engagement in our work: 

-	to provide independently facilitated evidence about public views and perceptions of topical or current issues in dental regulation;

-	to provide independently facilitated public and patient views on their experience of the quality of dental services;

The specific work required is as follows:
• Review of VOA's methodology for calculating the land and property liabilities and confirmation that this is in line with the Compensation Code.
• Review of a sample of 5 valuations supporting land and property provisions to assess whether, based on the information provided in the detailed valuation, the key assumptions and judgements are materially consistent with the Compensation Code. In terms of providing a reasonable estimate for valuation on the anticipated forecast outturn cost to settle compensation. This should also confirm that the area of land included in the liability is appropriate. These valuations will, depending on sample selection, cover multiple properties (e.g. where they cover the acquisition area for a whole road scheme) and so some degree of consideration of items contributing to the overall valuation may be necessary in these larger samples, as opposed to them being tightly restricted to a single property. Regardless of item size, we would in each case be looking for the auditor's expert to assess the material reasonableness of the valuation in question. In the prior year, a review of 5 valuations were reviewed by our auditor's expert; this review will focus attention on a different sample of 5 land and property valuations.

to modernise the regulatory framework for the Official Controls. Food Business 
Operators (FBOs) in the meat, wine and dairy sectors all have a direct relationship with 
the Food Standards Agency (FSA) via its Official Controls, including inspections, 
enforcement, advice and guidance.
In 2020, the FSA piloted research to better understand the views that FBOs in England 
and Wales had of the FSA and Official Controls. This research explored several areas 
including overall views of the FSA, FBOs understanding of the FSA's role and purpose, 
what FBOs value about the FSA and criticisms, FBOs experience of certain FSA 
processes, ease of compliance with FSA guidelines and requirements and their 
satisfaction with FSA communications. The research consisted of both quantitative and 
qualitative interviews with wine and meat FBOs and quantitative interviews with dairy 
FBOs

The findings report 'FSA and Official Controls: Research with food business operators'
was published in July 2020. The findings from the quantitative part of this research will 
form a baseline for the research we are now commissioning.
The FSA would like to commission this research to understand the views that FBOs 
now have, to identify and monitor changes in these views over time and the impact of 
FSA initiatives. 
We are commissioning this research for three further waves to be conducted on a 
biennial basis in 2022, 2024 and 2026. There will be a break clause after each wave of 
research has been delivered to review the need for the research, the process and to 
ensure alignment with FSA priorities. 
As part of this contract, we require flexibility to be built in to allow for additional pieces of 
research to be conducted to address emerging research needs in this area (see 
methodology section below). Any additional/ ad hoc research requests will be funded 
separately from the biennial waves of research and will be discussed with the 
successful tenderer.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,FSA.Procurement@food.gov.uk,"Foss House, Peasholme Green",,York,"YO1 7PR",England,,,"FSA contract FS900203 Understanding the Food System Contract Signed_Redacted.pdf ",,,14/03/2022,31/07/2026,11/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,248038.13,,18/03/2022,248038.13,"[IFF Research|Chart House, 16 Chart Street, Greater London, N1 6DD, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,14/03/2022,31/07/2026,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

The aim of the project is to give people 'their own front door' providing stable accommodation with flexible support dependent on need; enabling individuals to develop the skills and motivation to maintain a tenancy and move on to permanent accommodation. 

The provider will be flexible and innovative in their approach to meet the needs of individuals. Acknowledging that progress within this group is often demonstrated by small but significant steps.

Support will address substance and alcohol misuse, offending behaviours, physical and mental health issues. The aim of this support is to prevent self -defeating behaviours, break the cycle of rough sleeping and sofa surfing thus creating a ""no wrong door approach"".   

Support workers will be experienced in psychologically informed practices. They will have the skills to build trusting relationships with service users and the local knowledge and expertise to link in with a wide range of services, including healthcare, mental health, substance misuse. They will also provide support to develop life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and ensure financial and digital inclusion. 

The provider will also provide an emergency on call out of hours service.

The marginalisation and stigmatisation of this group means it is essential the project works closely with the local community.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regulates auditors, accountants and actuaries and sets the UK's Corporate Governance and Stewardship Codes. We seek to promote transparency and integrity in business; our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company accounts, audit and high-quality risk management. As the Competent Authority for audit in the UK, the FRC sets auditing and ethical standards and monitors and enforces audit quality.
This project concerns shareholder votes of 20% or more against resolutions at company Annual General Meetings (AGMs). We are interested in how such votes are reported and the level, and quality, of engagement that subsequently takes place between company boards and investors.


The aim of the research project was to assess: 

•	The level and quality of companies' reporting against Provision 4 of the Corporate Governance Code and the usefulness of this reporting to shareholders.
•	The level and quality of engagement between companies and their shareholders following a vote of 20% or more against a proposed resolution.
•	How this engagement has impacted companies' subsequent actions and subsequent shareholder stewardship, including engagement and voting.  
 
The research project supports the work of the Corporate Governance and Stewardship team in the FRC, as well as the broader aims of the FRC, to understand and promote good governance and best practice. The output from the research may be used in an FRC publication(s) and where this is the case the contribution of the contracted research team will be cited and acknowledged appropriately.

Scope of the Project
  
The research includes all companies that were constituents of the FTSE 350 index on 1 January 2019 and will cover all AGMs of those companies in 2019, 2020 and 2021.
 
Approach 
The data for this research is available from the following sources:
•	The Investment Association's public register
•	Companies' AGM notices
•	Companies' statements/updates/announcements (including those of AGM voting results)
•	Companies' annual reports
•	Other information sources (e.g. media coverage, stock exchange announcements, stewardship reports, dialogue with IA, etc). 

The successful bid established the criteria/scale to reliably assess:
•	Quality of reporting by companies in the areas listed
•	Quality of engagement between companies and shareholders
These criteria should allow for comparisons between companies and between time periods (within the scope of the research sample).",,"EC2Y 5AS",,"73000000 ","Head of Procurement",procurement@frc.org.uk,"8th Floor,125 London Wall",,LONDON,"EC2Y 5AS",England,"020 7492 2300",www.frc.org.uk,"01 Research Services ITT.pdf 02 Tender Response Final.docx ",,"THIS OPPORTUNITY IS CLOSED.

"NHS/SOEPS/21.809 CAN",Contract,"NHS SOUTH OF ENGLAND PROCUREMENT SERVICES",Awarded,2022-03-18T11:09:54Z,"Stroke Recovery Service","This notice is to inform the market that the Contracting Authorities (NHS East Sussex CCG, NHS West Sussex CCG, NHS Brighton and Hove CCG) have now awarded a 1 year contract with a 1 year contract extension option to The Stroke Association. The proposed contract will commence on 1st April 2022. 

A Stroke Recovery Service is currently provided in Sussex by The Stroke Association. Each CCG has a slightly different scope of service, but each is in place to provide support by The Stroke Association to stroke survivors on discharge from hospital, assessment, review, education on life after stroke, links and sign-posting to grants, peer support and other community and voluntary organisations, and including in some places a formal six-month review post discharge.

There is a need to align current stroke recovery services with national Integrated Stroke Delivery Network (ISDN) guidance and requirements, however the establishment of the Sussex ISDN and its work has been delayed due to local and national Covid-19 response and priorities.

There is a need to ensure continuity and consistency of service across Sussex prior to the future re-commissioning. Commissioners and Sussex ISDN managers will work with providers to ensure these requirements are appropriately developed on a local basis, and the proposed extension of this contract will support this. The current provider is currently working with NHS England on ISDN guidance. By taking this direct award action an equitable service is being made available to all Sussex residents/patients

As part of this continuity of service, the West Sussex service will be extended into the North Coastal West Sussex area, and this is to be added to the current contract under the same scope, service specification, and KPIs, and will equalise the service provision in West Sussex while further work is taking place across the Sussex Health and Care Partnership and with the ISDN to ensure the service will be developed in line with national requirement as well as local patient need.

The Authority will enter into a contract with the incumbent provider to ensure continuity of services, because no response/no requests to participate have been submitted in response to the Prior Information Notice.",,,"South East","85000000 ",,aelliott1@nhs.net,"Sackville House Brookes Close",,Lewes,"BN7 2FZ",England,"01273 403629",,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/soepscommissioning ","Please note: NHS England and Improvement have announced that the Sussex Health and Care Partnership, which is made up of all health and care organisations across East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove, has successfully met the criteria to become an Integrated Care System (ICS). An ICS is a way of working across health and care organisations that allows them to work closer together, to take collective responsibility of the health and wellbeing of populations across large areas.

It is not anticipated that the statutory responsibility or accountability of the individual health and care organisations working as an ICS will be affected, save for the expectation that CCG organisations will be abolished and functions transferred to the ICS.
