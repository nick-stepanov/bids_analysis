Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has become the largest military conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The Government of Ukraine has requested technical support to calculate the damages caused by the war and to use this data for effective recovery planning. The assistance will help develop a standardised set of methodologies for war damage assessment, cross-government capacity building and coordination, and will provide expert advisory and policy recommendations on integrating the damage assessment into the GoU's recovery planning. Because of the volatility and unpredictability of the situation, the project will be implemented in two phases (August-November 2022, November 2022-March 2023). Phase 1 will be dedicated to the analysis of the relevant international practices of damages assessment and recovery planning, consultations with stakeholders, development of a reporting framework, training of the civil servants in designated state institutions on data collection and storage, and initial recommendations on integration of the data on the damages into recovery planning. During the next phase the team will finalise the set of methodologies for war damage assessment, continue with capacity building of the state institutions, conduct data collection pilots, and provide recommendations on designing a product management plan for adapting an off-the-shelf GIS solution for the needs of Ukraine's recovery mapping.
Project objectives: The MF will provide tailored technical assistance to the GoU that will focus on designing a standardised set of methodologies for collecting information about war damages and losses, capacity building to equip civil servants across the government with tools and capacity to collect and analyse the data, and expert advice based on the best international practice on how to integrate the assessment of war damages and losses in the GoU policy documents, such as post-war recovery plans and legal claims to the international courts. The MF will work collaboratively with the GoU and facilitate dialogue with government stakeholders, members of the National Recovery Council, civil society and international donors to strengthen the GoU evidence-based approach to ensure suggested policies and donor support stay relevant to the context, inclusive and conflict-sensitive.",,,Ukraine,"73000000 ","Zuzanna Pogorzelska",zuzanna.pogorzelska@abtbritain.co.uk,"1 Chamberlain Square",,BIRMINGHAM,SE12RD,England,"'+44 (0)20 3874 3440",,,,,05/08/2022,31/03/2023,28/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,633824,,01/08/2022,633823,"[Kyiv School of Economics and Management (KSEM)|3 Mykoly Shpaka street, Kyiv, Ukraine, 03113|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No][Centre for Economic Strategy (CES)|36D Saksaganskoho street, Kyiv, Ukraine, 02000|NONE_OTHER||Yes|No]",,05/08/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,18:00

The Service will support the recruitment to key governor roles of a diverse range of candidates who have skills, knowledge and experience appropriate to those roles.

To ensure that the service is targeted on those college governing boards which have the greatest need of help, referrals will be made via the Department. Priority will be given to colleges identified by Department colleagues. However, colleges will also be able to apply to the Department for consideration, for example, where they have experienced considerable difficulty in filling to the role of chair or committee chair, or in covering a particularly significant skills gap on the board.

The Department will assess and prioritise referrals to fit the targets and workflows set out in the contract with the Supplier. In making referrals to the Service, the Department will prioritise cases and roles where a quality appointment is judged to be key to strengthening governance in any given College. This could include but would not be limited to chairs, deputy chairs, and committee chairs for finance and audit.

Suppliers will be expected to have capacity and capability to deliver a quality service to college governing boards, taking into account the challenges of FE governor recruitment, and the demands and responsibilities of being an FE governor. Suppliers must also have due regard to the DfE FE Governance Guide and to the relevant governance codes.

The Supplier shall deliver a minimum of 137 well-matched, diverse and lasting appointments to governor roles during the Contract Period (subject to sufficient referrals).

The Real-Time Indicators team works to develop and publish experimental indicators which measure and reflect changes in the UK economy and society. The team provide a timely picture of a range of activities that supplement official economic statistics and aid economic and monetary policymakers and analysts in interpreting the economic situation, and this is done using rapid response surveys, novel data sources and experimental methods. 

Footfall can be used to understand changes in consumer behaviour, and changes in it are associated with changes in retail and economic activity. As an indicator it can be used by policymakers to understand consumer confidence and highstreet performance. 

The Contracting Authority has previously received national footfall figures. This data showed overall UK retail footfall, as well as footfall by high street, retail park, and shopping centre category. Data could be used for illustrative purposes in the statistical bulletin, with underlying data not available to users. For this requirement the Contracting Authority are looking to build upon this and receive more granular data, and further category breakdowns. 

This data forms part of our week real-time indicator statistical bulletin, as an indicator of consumer behaviour, showing changes in the volume of visits to location types and regions.

The Fuel Poor Network Extension Scheme (FPNES) was first introduced in April 2016 to support the 20% of UK homes located within the Government's Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The scheme was delivered by the Gas Distribution Networks (GDNs) and Independent Gas Transporters (IGTs) in partnership with other partner organisations to help cover the costs of connecting off-grid, fuel poor households to the UKs gas network.

The Energy Company Obligation scheme (ECO) was first introduced in 2013 with the Government setting energy suppliers strict targets to support fuel poor households to find more affordable ways to heat their homes.

Both schemes were Government implemented and regulated by OFGEM to ensure that fuel poor households were provided with a real alternative to their existing inefficient heating provision which had previously been restricted to a single source of energy.

Following a programme of stock condition profiling of its housing stock, Stonewater quickly identified those assets that satisfied the strict qualification criteria for each funding scheme. The main objective being to identify all assets within its portfolio that were currently heated by aged and inefficient electric night storage heaters and electrically heated hot water storage systems, in addition to other qualifying measures.

Under existing scheme rules for either one or both funding opportunities, Welbeck and Bentinck Street in Sutton-in -Ashfield was selected as the first scheme to take advantage of this Government backed initiative to achieve these goals.

With 30 fully funded gas connections now installed under IMD rules and ECO3 funding secured for qualifying assets, Stonewater are now looking to implement a programme of First Time Central Heating (FTCH) installations to maximise the amount of financial support currently available thorough each scheme. These systems will include innovative design characteristics to maximise efficiency to further reduce operating costs and carbon emissions.

The above overview supports Stonewater's key strategic sustainability plan to provide its customers with affordable forms of heating to end fuel poverty and to support the Government's future net-zero ambitions.",,,"United Kingdom","45331100 ","Andrew Russell",andrew.russell@stonewater.org,"Suite C, Lancaster House,Grange Business Park, Enderby Road, Whetstone",,LEICESTER,"LE8 6EP",England,07387024336,,,,"All details relating to this tender exercise can be located through the Delta eSourcing portal, https://www.delta-esourcing.com/ using access code 62E4YJ973A",18/07/2022,17/07/2023,17/06/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,166000,,02/08/2022,154829.85,"[GRANT STORE LIMITED|Unit 20,Makerfield Way, Ince

\r
The Council must ensure it achieves the most value and the best long-term condition for its road and footway assets. To do this, the Council needs to understand the condition of its assets to target planned works at the locations where it will deliver the most value. The Council achieves this by regularly surveying the condition of its roads and footways. The results of these surveys are used to measure and report the overall network condition, identify sites for works where it is likely to achieve the best outcomes and undertake strategic modelling of asset condition in the future.\r
\r
The council requires a data system to feed the survey results into, for further analysis. The data service is used to carry out complex lifecycle modelling, allowing for better planning and management of the asset.\r

Purpose of Government Supported Community Learning:
• Maximise access to community learning for adults, bringing new opportunities and improving lives, whatever people's circumstances.
• Promote social renewal by bringing local communities together to experience the joy of learning and the pride that comes with achievement.
• Maximise the impact of community learning on the social and economic well-being of individuals, families and communities.
Objectives
• Focus public funding on people who are disadvantaged and least likely to participate, including in rural areas and people on low incomes with low skills
• Collect fee income from people who can afford to pay and use where possible to extend provision to those who cannot.
• Widen participation and transform people's destinies by supporting progression relevant to personal circumstances, e.g. improved confidence and willingness to engage in learning - acquisition of skills preparing people for training, employment or self-employment
- improved digital, financial literacy and/or communication skills
- Parents/carers better equipped to support and encourage their children's learning
- Improved/maintained health and/or social well-being.
• Develop stronger communities, with more self-sufficient, connected and pro-active citizens, leading to:
o increased volunteering, civic engagement and social integration
o reduced costs on welfare, health and anti-social behaviour
o increased online learning and self-organised learning
o the lives of our most troubled families being turned around
• Commission, deliver and support learning in ways that contribute directly to these objectives, including:
o bringing together people from backgrounds, cultures and income groups, including people who can/cannot afford to pay
o using effective local partnerships to bring together key providers and relevant local agencies and services
o devolving planning and accountability to neighbourhood/parish level, with local people involved in decisions about the learning offer involving volunteers and Voluntary and Community Sector groups, shifting long term, 'blocked' classes into learning clubs, growing self-organised learning groups, and encouraging employers to support informal learning in the workplace
o supporting the wide use of online information and learning resources
o minimising overheads, bureaucracy & administration
The Council's Community and Family Learning (CFL) has agreed to provide the grant of £95,000 (the 'Grant') to the Provider for the delivery of a minimum of 17 programmes to 185 learner numbers.

This is particularly true for smaller companies which are the backbone of the UK economy, driving growth and creating employment opportunities. 

HMRC has existing methods of engagement with large businesses to gain their views on managing their CT obligations. HMRC wants to conduct research to better understand the experiences and support needs of smaller and mid-sized businesses. 

In addition, insight suggests that some micro-businesses choose to trade as a limited company without fully understanding what this involves. This has consequences for corporate and personal compliance and can create unforeseen administrative burdens for the customer. To support policy changes, HMRC wants to better understand the experiences of these businesses once they have incorporated.

Each Lloyd George envelope has a broad range of detailed personal information stored inside and maintaining the security accuracy, availability and integrity of these legacy records is vital. The handling of these records needs particular care; the paper records can be up to 70 years old and some records are fragile and in a poor state, coupled with the fact the information they hold is vital and paramount for safe medical practice. The lack of continuity and resilience within the paper record poses a risk to the ongoing, continuity of person-centred care.. There is a legal requirement to keep the full patients record for a minimum of 10 years after the death of a patient.

There are four primary reasons for digitisation of Lloyd George records:
•	safer care for patients 
•	release of space within practices to provide additional consultation areas
•	access to the full patient record at the point of care
•	GP Contract commitments to digitise all Lloyd George patient records by March 2022.

Aims and Objectives of the Project


The aim of this project is to gain in-depth insight into whether international manufacturing businesses and the UK-based importers of their goods are aware of the new UKCA requirements, whether they are acting on them, the sort of challenges/barriers they face in adjusting to these changes and whether businesses have access to the relevent conformity assessment services if they need them.
This information will help BEIS to address the question of whether non-UK manufacturing businesses and their UK-based importers are ready for the new UKCA requirements. It will also aid in addressing questions on the extent to disruptions to the economy and supply chains that could occur by the end of standstill (1 January 2023). 

There is a legal obligation for UK-based importers of non-UK manufactured goods to ensure correct product marking (if required). Therefore, this research will focus on gaining information on the readiness of UK-based importers and through them the readiness of non-UK manufactures for UKCA.",,"SW1H 0ET",,"73200000 79300000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House","North Star Avenue",SWINDON,"SN2 1FF",England,"01793 867000",www.uksbs.co.uk,"PS22169 - RM6126-Order-Form and Schedules redacted.pdf ",,,08/08/2022,31/10/2022,01/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,80000,,02/08/2022,75385,"[I.F.F RESEARCH LIMITED|5th Floor,St. Magnus House, 3 Lower Thames Street

As a Local Authority we have a statutory duty to consult with members of the public on certain decisions, and whilst that engagement and consultation cannot rely solely on digital methods, a high-quality, accessible, and user-friendly digital engagement platform which facilitates our wider ambitions to be a listening and responsive organisation is required.  This is where you as a supplier come in with your solution to support our ambition to be an organisation that works with local communities to better the city. The public want more options for online engagement, which is more flexible, succinct, and usable for their lives and priorities in 2022 and for the future; and the public now expect a wider range of engagement approaches rather than solely online surveys (although this function is still essential.) As the fourth largest city in the UK, we should be setting the standard for community engagement, and this underpins our ambition. Your proposed solution should also factor in it being a corporate solution for the whole Council, and having one platform that suits the needs of the whole organisation is the best use of resource but also allows for oversight of all the digital engagement we're undertaking as an organisation meaning we're less likely to ask the same people the same questions and we make our data and insight work smarter than it is.

PD-743-22-TH,Contract,"Coventry University",Awarded,2022-10-19T16:00:46+01:00,"SUPPLY OF AUDIO-VISUAL INSTALLATION AND SUPPORT","AV has traditionally been an area that has proven challenging to manage on an on-going basis. Our AV environments are continually under review and under constant refresh cycles due to our size and business growth. Repeated and lengthy tendering processes for small to large AV activities cause delays to work that aligns to key dates for both new buildings, hubs and core academic calendar events. Coventry University therefore wishes to undertake a formal procurement for the following items:

1.	To award a contract with a single supplier for the ongoing maintenance of all audio-visual systems. Including 'remote call home' capabilities for fix and resolution. Architect-as-a Service and strategic roadmap guidance and steering. 

2.	To award a single supplier for the supply and installation of new audio-visual systems to support the on-going replacement / upgrades of older audio-visual installations, plus any new requirements that the University may have.

3.	To award a 3-year contract with a +1 option for extension. 

This is a competitive procurement, conducted as Mini Competition as a Call Off from the North East Purchasing Consortium (NEUPC) Audio Visual: Supplies, System Design, Installation and Maintenance Agreement; West Midlands Lot 4b: Large Contracts.

Detailed work as follows:
Work Schedule: - Silt Removal:
Silt in Pond - approx. 290 cube
• Cofferdams to be set up splitting the pond into 3 or 4 areas
• Inlets and outlet to be diverted where required
• Silt allowed to drain and then removed from Pond
• Silt to be stored and dried next to pond then taken away from site
• Disposal of silt as recommended by local authority (The Council may have a location to remove the silt too, via a local farmer and the Council's allotments, but this is not guaranteed).
Work Schedule - Walkway:
• The concrete walkway above the brick walls is no longer even, and provides a trip hazard for walkers.  It has been repaired with Tarmac in order to get the differing levels to ""meet"", but now requires re-setting to ensure an even walkway around the entire pond.
Work Schedule - Wall Damage:
• As the damage to the walls is only visual above the water line a further inspection would be required when each section is drained
• All existing brickwork to be jet washed for closer inspection
• Any failing brickwork to be replaced
• Any lose mortar to be replaced between brickwork
• The movement in the walls will make future guarantees limited on any works undertaken
Note:  The pond is not leaking, and the base of the pond is estimated to be a proportion of cement, and a proportion of clay (the surrounding area is made up of London Clay)
Work Schedule - Island:
• An inspection is required below water line of the brickwork
• Some copings to be re-laid or replaced as necessary
Work Schedule - Introduction of Aquatic Planting:
• It would be possible to introduce some planting zones, but these would be required to be separated from the fish
• Shallow marginals or floating planters could be introduced
• Plants provide a balanced aquatic eco-system and would help keep the phosphate levels lower
Work Schedule: Inlets and outlets
• The outlet could be modified to allow for greater collection of silt and floating debris, this could help alleviate any future flooding of the road
• The inlet from the feeder SuDS pond requires a silt trap, as currently it appears as an open pipe",,"co5 0tj",,"45300000 71400000 77800000 ","Rob Williams",clerk@tiptreeparishcouncil.gov.uk,"56 Church Road, Tiptree",Tiptree,Colchester,"CO5 0SU","United Kingdom",01321817030,www.tiptreeparishcouncil.gov.uk,"Lake re-build ITT.pdf ",,,01/08/2022,30/09/2022,08/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Works,100000,250000,03/08/2022,81309,"[The A.G.A. group Limited|Merton Hall Ponds

London Care Limited following market engagement to invite capable providers. London Care Limited has been established as the only capable provider.

NHS North West London Integrated Care Board (""NHS NW London ICB"" or ""ICB"") required a Central London (Westminster) based provision of a Dementia Advisor (DA) to deliver post-diagnostic support, information and advice to people with a diagnosis of dementia. The main focus is supporting people with a recent diagnosis, and/or in early stages, to live well with dementia, to help them to stay independent and access services in the community. The DA also remains as point of contact for people with dementia from diagnosis through to end-of-life. The post holder provides information on local support services for the person with dementia, providing advice and signposting as and when required. Even though the main focus for the DA is the person with a diagnosis of dementia (rather than Carers), the DA closely liaises with families and friends of the person with dementia as required. The post holder also takes an active role in the delivery of Westminster Memory Café sessions, raises awareness about dementia in the community, takes an active role in the Dementia Friendly Communities initiative and builds links and relationships to enhance partnership working with other services/organisations across the dementia pathway.

The aims of the service are to offer high quality post-diagnostic support, information and advice to:
Promote an understanding of dementia & manage the symptoms of dementia;
Help people live more independently;
Enable easy access to services, seek out the right support at the right time; 
Feel in control of their life and their future;
Reduce isolation, rebuild their support network;
Better manage their mental & physical health; and
Empower people to live well with dementia.",,"NW1 5JD","United Kingdom","85100000 85000000 75200000 ","NHS North West London Contracts Team",nhsnwlccg.contracting@nhs.net,"15 Marylebone Road",,London,"NW1 5JD","United Kingdom",,,,,,01/04/2022,31/03/2023,31/03/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,52375.5,52375.5,02/08/2022,52375.5,"[London Care Limited|42 Westbourne Park Road W2 5PH|NONE||No|No]",,01/04/2022,31/03/2023,"Other ",,12:00

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regulates auditors, accountants and actuaries and sets the UK's Corporate Governance and Stewardship Codes. We seek to promote transparency and integrity in business; our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company accounts, audit, and high-quality risk management.

A high-quality audit provides investors and other stakeholders with a high level of assurance that the financial statements of an entity give a true and fair view of its performance and financial position, and provide a reliable and trustworthy basis for taking decisions. All companies in the UK are required, under the Companies Act, to have their annual accounts audited externally, unless exempt. There are many firms in the UK that can carry out these statutory audits. 


The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is commissioning research to enhance understanding of firm entry, growth and exit in the PIE and non-PIE audit markets. The research should generate insights that will help inform the FRC's future work and regulatory approaches and support the FRC's objective to create a more resilient audit market through greater competition and choice.

The project will be comprised of two parts:
A.	PIE audit market
B.	Non-PIE audit market

The purpose of the project is to support the FRC in its objective to 'create a more resilient audit market through greater competition and choice'.  The research will generate insights into the PIE and non-PIE audit markets to help inform the FRC's future work and regulatory approaches. The overall objective of the research is to enhance understanding of firm entry, growth and exit in the PIE and non-PIE audit markets.

•	The objective of Part A is to better understand the appetite of audit and non-audit firms  to enter, or expand their presence in, the PIE audit market. This will include understanding any barriers they face in achieving this, and what action(s) may lower these barriers.  

•	The objective of Part B is to better understand the economics of audit firms in the non-PIE audit market, as well as what has driven the decline in the number of such firms over the last five years.  The research in Part B should also produce an analysis of the implications of the declining number of firms, whether positive or negative, for choice, competition and audit quality.",,"EC2Y 5AS",,"73000000 ","Head of Procurement",procurement@frc.org.uk,"8Th Floor,125 London Wall",,LONDON,EC2Y5AS,England,"020 7492 2300",,"01 ITT Final.pdf 02 Final Tender Response doc.docx 03 Research Services Agreement draft.pdf ",,"THIS IS A CONTRACT AWARD NOTICE.

turkey, chicken, goat and equine species. White fish samples are analysed using a

independent confirmatory analysis by a third-party laboratory, using
appropriate DNA-based methodology for species verification and an assessment of
how much is present; employing 1% weight for weight (w/w) as the figure above

process will identify as 'positive' all samples where there is a greater than 0.5%

The aim of this procurement is to award two contracts within the budgetary envelope set out in the notice. The military relies heavily on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), but GNSS signals are vulnerable to interference. In addition, many environments in which our military operates (inside buildings, in urban canyons, under dense foliage, underwater, and underground) have limited or no GNSS signal availability. To solve this challenge, the Alt Nav programme seeks to provide GNSS-quality PNT to military users regardless of the operational environment. This involves the merging of data within the navigation system design to prolong the availability of the PNT solution from traditional and emerging sources. The Data Merging task is the subject of this competition.

The proposed contractor(s) shall attend project management meetings to discuss information inclusive of but not limited to progress on technology development, exploitation studies, lessons learnt, details of architecture. The proposed contractor(s) shall provide a technology demonstration proving maturation of data merging technology to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 (TRL descriptions can be seen in additional text within this contract notice), followed by a technical report for contract completion. The project meetings, final report and demonstration will address the following themes:
Theme 1 - Preparing for near-term exploitation of Alt Nav technologies on existing MoD applications; defining and solving the engineering orientated problems of real-life examples of Data Merging and Theme 2 - Reporting lessons learned from the first task into MoD&apos;s ongoing Data Fusion Research and Development activities. In the event that Data Source contractor(s) are not able to mature the Interface Control Documentation (ICD) on time - work with the Authority to select appropriate, industry standard ICDs and data fields e.g:

- Mil GPS - GPS ICD-153 (available from the UK GNSS PO)
- Open Signal GNSS - NMEA-0183
- Inertial Measurement Unit - STANAG 4572 Open System Architecture Interface to enable simulator laboratory testing of integrated INS/GPS equipment (e.g. using SPIRENT&apos;s Sim INERTIAL simulation capability (or equivalent).
- Alt Nav Data Source - The ASPN interfaces from SET-309
- Illustrative Alt Nav Data source - based on STANAG 4278 Method of Expressing Navigation Accuracies and Draft STANAG 5645 GNSS Receiver Sensor Host ICD.

The geography for the lots is based upon constituency boundaries rather than Local Plan spatial planning boundaries, although there is a degree of cross-over between the two.  The city commission (Lot 1) excludes the geographical area of Shipley and Baildon (both part of the regional city for panning purposes), although it is expected that there will be a strong crossover and connection between the development framework areas.       Lot 1 combines a development framework for the city (with Bradford parliamentary constituencies) together with an important new masterplan for Bradford Southern Gateway and an urban design framework with related services for Holme Wood.

      In May 2021, the Deuteration Facility at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) site in Oxfordshire suffered a major fire. Whilst the fire damage remained isolated to the room, the laboratory suffered extensive damage and required complete clearance. This project is to reinstate the facility and bring it back to full operations capacity. 
      
      The full infrastructure will need to be replaced and refitted from utilities, fume cupboards and furniture to synthetic and analytical equipment lost to heat, smoke and water damage. 
      
      As part of the fit out, STFC would like to incorporate the latest safety development designs on all fume cupboards, laboratory equipment and furniture. The design is to ensure that the facility is as energy efficient as possible using a designed for purpose BMS system to control the balance between the extract and supply air, whilst maintaining the internal comfort temperature within the required parameters. 
      
      Provision, installation and commissioning of the laboratory requirements includes, HVAC, furniture, ceiling flooring, electrical and mechanical fit, water specialist gases, gas detection systems etc.
      
      Site Tour:
      UKRI STFC will be holding a site tour for this requirement. It is strongly recommended that Potential Suppliers attend the site tour at RAL in order to gain complete clarity of the requirements and the environment you would be working in. Site tours will be held on Monday 13th June 2022 at 14:00 and Tuesday 14th June 2022 at 10:00 and will last no more than 1 hour. Suppliers need only attend one of these tours. Two attendees from each supplier organisation are permitted to attend a site tour at RAL.
      
      To book on to the site tour, please submit the names, email addresses and vehicle registration numbers of those attending via the message function on the Delta eSourcing Portal, along with the date you wish to attend.

The purpose of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is to serve the public interest by setting high standards of corporate governance, reporting and audit and by holding to account those responsible for delivering them.

Each year the FRC assesses a sample of FTSE350 annual reports to examine the quality of reporting against the UK Corporate Governance Code. An important element of the assessment is the extent to which companies comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, and where they do not, the quality of their explanations. 

The 'comply or explain' nature of the Corporate Governance Code allows companies to adjust their approach to governance as appropriate for their business model and individual circumstances. Therefore, in some cases, non-compliance or partial compliance with the Corporate Governance Code is the right approach for a company.

The FRC is also responsible for the UK Stewardship Code which sets out the Principles of good investment stewardship. Investors are asked to disclose which third parties they use to support their stewardship activities, the services provided and how they are monitored and held to account. In particular, the Stewardship Code requires signatories to state the extent to which they use the default recommendations of proxy advisors.  

The aim of this research project is to examine how investors' stewardship and behaviour is affected by those recommendations and ratings. This includes understanding where, and in what circumstances, engagement takes place among companies, investors, and proxy advisors/ESG ratings agencies.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this research project is to answer several questions: 
  
A.	What are the impacts of recommendations/ratings given by proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies on FTSE350 companies' behaviour and reporting, and investor voting decisions? This should include the impact on governance policies and practices, and on so-called ""tick box"" behaviour. 
B.	What have been the processes and outcomes of engagement over the last two years among FTSE350 companies, investors, and proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies? We are particularly interested in three types of bilateral engagement: 
i.	Between FTSE350 companies and proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies on recommendations/ratings given by the latter. 
ii.	Between investors and proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies on recommendations/ratings given by the latter. 
iii.	Between investors and FTSE350 companies on recommendations/ratings given by proxy voting/ESG ratings agencies. 
In answering this question, we would also like the appointed research team to quantify the frequency of such engagements over the last two years. 
C.	What are the barriers to effective engagement between the parties as set out above? 
The purpose of this research project is to inform future policy work by the FRC or other agencies.",,"EC2Y 5AS",,"73000000 ","Head of Procurement",procurement@frc.org.uk,"8Th Floor,125 London Wall",,LONDON,EC2Y5AS,England,"020 7492 2300",,"01 Proxy_Advisors_ITT Final.pdf 02 Tender Response Final.docx ",,"THIS IS A CONTRACT AWARD NOTICE",08/08/2022,17/03/2023,20/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,45000,55000,04/08/2022,49000,"[Morrow Sodali Limited|Nations House,

Priority areas for this procurement are based on the Essex County Council, Levelling-Up geographies, and Working Families priority areas, overlayed with the 2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). 

It is important that any Community Supermarket is established with the support of local, public, voluntary and community sector partners as well as local residents and service users.

The Community Supermarket model will primarily support those individuals and families who fluctuate above and below the line of financial security providing a consistent point of support to avoid them falling into financial crisis. 

Once established, the programmes will form a local responsibility with funding from Essex County Council only available as a one-off award in order to seed fund the development.
 
There will be ongoing support from Essex County Council, working alongside National experts Feeding Britain through a best practice and information sharing 'Good Food Essex Network'. 

This procurement opportunity represents the first phase of delivery for the Community Supermarket programme. Subsequent phases of procurement in areas of geographic priority, will be dependent on the successful mobilisation of Phase 1.

Procurement will take the form of two geographical (lots) with the financial contribution to any one lot capped at £79,120. 

Bidders may submit bids for one Lot only. There will only be one supplier per Lot.

For a community supermarket to be successful requires a local partnership between the District/ Borough or City Council, Voluntary Sector and the local community. As such it is envisaged that the Essex Community Supermarket Programme will be led by local partnerships coming together to access resources and work alongside national experts Feeding Britain, to utilise funding made available by ECC to plan and deliver community provision in areas if identified need. 

The costs covered by this one-off award are expected to be sufficient to sustain the project for a period of 18months in total. 12 months within the terms of this contract, and a further 6 months beyond the conclusion of this contract.",,,"East of England","98000000 ","Andrew Beaver",Andrew.beaver@essex.gov.uk,"County Hall","Market Road",Chelmsford,"CM1 1QH","United Kingdom",,https://www.essex.gov.uk/,,"http://procontract.due-north.com/Login ",,01/07/2022,30/06/2023,22/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,NotApplicable,158000,158000,01/08/2022,158000,"[Jaywick Community Resource Centre Association|CO15 2JP|NONE||Yes|No][Billericay and Basildon Street Pastors|CM12 9AB|NONE||Yes|No]",,02/08/2022,01/08/2023,"Open ",,12:00
