We are seeking consultancy support due to the tight timeframe that we are working within to analyse and produce the updated NPSs and the Government Response.

We anticipate that you will meet with appropriate policy leads for EN1, EN3 and EN5 of the NPS on a regular basis (likely to be once every one to two weeks) for the duration of the contract.

Purpose of Government Supported Community Learning:
• Maximise access to community learning for adults, bringing new opportunities and improving lives, whatever people's circumstances.
• Promote social renewal by bringing local communities together to experience the joy of learning and the pride that comes with achievement.
• Maximise the impact of community learning on the social and economic well-being of individuals, families and communities.
Objectives
• Focus public funding on people who are disadvantaged and least likely to participate, including in rural areas and people on low incomes with low skills
• Collect fee income from people who can afford to pay and use where possible to extend provision to those who cannot.
• Widen participation and transform people's destinies by supporting progression relevant to personal circumstances, e.g. improved confidence and willingness to engage in learning - acquisition of skills preparing people for training, employment or self-employment
- improved digital, financial literacy and/or communication skills
- Parents/carers better equipped to support and encourage their children's learning
- Improved/maintained health and/or social well-being.
• Develop stronger communities, with more self-sufficient, connected and pro-active citizens, leading to:
o increased volunteering, civic engagement and social integration
o reduced costs on welfare, health and anti-social behaviour
o increased online learning and self-organised learning
o the lives of our most troubled families being turned around
• Commission, deliver and support learning in ways that contribute directly to these objectives, including:
o bringing together people from backgrounds, cultures and income groups, including people who can/cannot afford to pay
o using effective local partnerships to bring together key providers and relevant local agencies and services
o devolving planning and accountability to neighbourhood/parish level, with local people involved in decisions about the learning offer involving volunteers and Voluntary and Community Sector groups, shifting long term, 'blocked' classes into learning clubs, growing self-organised learning groups, and encouraging employers to support informal learning in the workplace

Operating drop-in services from town centre, non-GP premises locations where homeless and rough sleepers already access services, working closely with the Rough Sleepers Initiatives (RSI), this service will address the often complex health and care needs of this vulnerable group. The service will operate in the Eastbourne, Lewes and Wealden area while supporting services in East Sussex through close collaboration with the RSI service. We aim to deliver a robust and transformative model of care to homeless people and rough sleepers which specifically delivers the following:

• GP drop-in clinics specifically for homeless people and rough sleepers for treatment, health checks and signposting/support as appropriate

• Community nurse drop-in clinic and outreach, linking into patient pathways that support appointments, appropriate admissions, patient management and improving hospital discharge processes

• Support, navigation, and co-ordination to access primary and secondary health services and to assist with GP registration. This will include triage and assessment, remote support and care continuity at accommodation sites. The service will also help to facilitate/maintain necessary inpatient episode(s) of care",,,"South East","85000000 ","Stuart Meredith",stuart.meredith@soeprocurement.nhs.uk,"Sackville House, Brooks Close",,Lewes,"BN7 2FZ",England,,,,"https://in-tendhost.co.uk/soepscommissioning/aspx/Home ",,23/11/2022,22/11/2025,31/10/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,672264,,01/11/2022,672264,"[Victoria Medical Centre|153a Victoria Drive

The CLARA Timing Network distributes laser pulses from a fibre laser system to various end stations in the CLARA Accelerator via timing stabilised optical fibres.

DVSA want to enable data-driven decision-making.  Data that lacks accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or granularity to inform a decision presents a risk. We want to understand whether the information we have is good enough, the investment that is required if it is not.  This will enable DVSA to ensure that changes to applications and data also are able to have an investment on the value of the data aligned to benefits of the change.

DVSA also need to develop a Data Governance operation model, and this will form part of this work also. 

 
Outcomes 
DVSA will have value assigned to its data sets enabling the business to describe changes to applications and the effect it has on the value of the data held by DVSA.

This procurement is being concluded following a Open Market tender

Brief Description of Requirement

Eco-labels can guide environmentally conscientious customers to select products and services based on trustworthy environmental and social criteria. This informs purchasing decisions by providing information on environmental footprint of how the products have been manufactured and produced, which is often opaque and complex due to global supply chains.  It remains challenging to make sustainable purchase decisions for most of customers. 

To date, there are currently no internationally agreed standards for environmental sustainability labelling, and with around 460 eco labels globally there is a growing need for a consistency framework informed by environmental science data to help customers to understand genuinely environmentally friendly products . In addition, there is no agreed measures of product sustainability, e.g., greenhouse gas emission, water use and biodiversity impact etc . As such, the Chief Scientific Officer at Food Standard Agency (FSA) has recently urged an urgent introduction to an eco-labelling system through collaboration between business, academia and government, so that the food system can be set on a path to sustainability. He explained ""Transforming the food system into one that is fully sustainable relies on a unified approach to data sharing and food labelling that is both transparent and accurate. The eco-labelling of foods, for example, can enable consumers to compare the environmental footprint of different products and enable them to make choices about the impact this has on their diet. This requires unprecedented level of collaboration between business, academia and government. Developing a single (eco-label) system will require close coordination between business, an enhanced assurance capability for regulators and expert input from behaviour science to be sure the end product is clearly and accurately understood by consumers"". He highlighted ""there is a golden opportunity now for businesses to work together with each other and the public sector in order to create a coherent voluntary scheme that can be easily morphed into a mandatory one in due course"".   A mandatory food nutrient label has helped to drive business changes (e.g., reformulation) and made it easier for public to make better informed food choices.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue,",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,"PS22268 - UKRI Precedent Supplies Services Contract - redacted.pdf ",,,11/11/2022,30/03/2023,21/10/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,79600,,03/11/2022,79600,"[ICF CONSULTING SERVICES LIMITED|UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,11/11/2022,30/03/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,11:00

      The development is part of phase 1 of a scheme that will result in the building of over 6,000 residential units in the Great Jackson St area alone by 2029. The plans include development of a single form entry primary school and a designated 'medical centre / GP Practice' space (equivalent to an 8,000-10,000 list practice). Population growth provides a clear evidence base for the need for new space for a medical facility. The development of primary care new-build at the Great Jackson Street development potentially goes some way towards resolving future capacity issues.
      
      The fit out project will create a new health centre within the ground and first floor unit in the Elizabeth Tower development. The centre will include 16 clinical rooms, 1 administration room and a range of communal facilities. The space will be occupied by three GP practices and any remaining clinical space will be available for use on a flexible basis, both by the tenant GP practices and other health providers. NHS Property Services owns the headlease for the unit. The remainder of the tower consists of residential flats and associated facilities.
