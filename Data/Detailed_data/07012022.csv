This will ensure the effective involvement of parents, carers and young people in the design and delivery of SEND services and provision, including the continued embedding of the voices of SEND stakeholders in national policy development, to support system-wide improvements. We would require the Strategic Participation programme to respond to the long-term impact of Covid-19 (coronavirus) in the delivery of its business objectives and adapt its delivery in light of emerging priorities and recommendations identified through the SEND Review.

Through empowering children and young people with SEND and their parents to make informed choices about the provision available to them and supporting them to influence SEND policy at an individual, local and national level, services and provision can be designed in a way that works for children and young people user-centered system that meets their needs at the right level, this will counter the perception that statutory Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans and specialist provision are the only means through which children and young people with SEND can be properly supported. This in turn will reduce pressure on local delivery systems and demand for higher cost provision procuring a contract to continue existing participation and coproduction arrangements, consolidated with existing arrangements for a national helpline and online support service to provide information and advice to parents whose children have SEND.
This would provide the necessary government intervention to consolidate and grow meaningful participation and coproduction by families at an individual, local and national level.

Regulation of this focuses primarily on preventing sewer flooding from taking place. But it is also important to understand the service customers receive when it does occur.
This contract is for qualitative research with household water customers who have experienced sewer flooding. 
The objectives of the research are:
•	Set out the range of experiences household customers face when they experience a sewer flooding incident - covering short, medium and longer term (depending on length of time between incident and interview).
•	Examine the responses of wastewater companies to sewer flooding incidents, looking at differences by type of sewer flooding incident and across companies.
•	Understand the responses of other companies to sewer flooding incidents (e.g. insurance companies) and the role of wastewater companies in this context.
•	Consider the levels of customer satisfaction in relation to company responses to sewer flooding incidents, and the reasons for this.
•	Identify good and bad practice. 
Approach:
We expect the research to include:
1.	Depth interviews with customers who have experienced sewer flooding in their home. 
•	These interviews may be one-to-one depths or paired depths - depending on the circumstances and preferences of the household.
•	The interviews may be online or by telephone.
•	The interviews should include people with a mix of sewer flooding experiences (such as internal/external, single incident/multiple incident, mix of severity).
2.	Online focus groups with some of the participants in the depth interviews: bringing together participants to consider good practice.
Scope:
The research must consider:
•	The human impact of sewer flooding on the household: what happened, the scale of the incident, the disruption caused, the impact on individuals in the household.
•	Response of, and interaction with, companies: which companies were involved in the incident; what was the role of the wastewater company, including:
o	How responsive was the company
o	What did the company do / what was the quality of the clean up
o	How well did the company communicate at different stages (e.g. when the incident first happened, and longer-term).
•	Whether the sewer flooding has been resolved, including measures that have been put in place to prevent repeat episodes, concerns that repeat incidences may take place.
•	The cost of sewer flooding incidents, including: who covered the costs (e.g. insurance); was any compensation received from the wastewater company; what was the financial costs for the household.
•	Overall, level of satisfaction with companies' responses to incidents and an understanding of what good practice looks like for such incidents.
It should also consider any further relevant areas that will help Ofwat and CCW achieve our objectives.

"GAD - 202104 - ESG - Invitation to Tender",Contract,"Government Actuary Department",Awarded,2022-07-26T14:24:23+01:00,"Government Actuary's Department - Stochastic Economic Scenarios","A key part of our advice relates to, or relies on, the potential outturns for key economic variables - in particular in relation to asset returns, inflation and future interest rates. To support our advice in this area, GAD are looking to tender for a contract for the provision of a set of stochastic economic scenarios (""scenarios"", ""scenario set"" or ""economic scenario file""). 

The economic scenario file should contain stochastic forecasts of economic scenarios covering inflation, interest rates, credit, derivatives, FX and a range of asset classes. The scenarios are used in several areas of our advice, particularly for asset liability model runs for pension schemes, and are used to examine and illustrate the potential range of possible future outcomes. 

We require that a set of scenarios be provided to us regularly, at least quarterly, over the period of the contract. We also required that the scenarios:
i)	are based on sound economic principles and methods; 
ii)	are calibrated to reflect the market and economic conditions at the effective date of the calibration to ensure consistency with the date at which they are used; and
iii)	are calibrated to reflect either the provider's own view or GAD's own house-view on the long-term outcome for key economic variables in the scenario set.

GAD does not currently have a current provider of this service, though we have previously purchased one-off calibrations to support particular projects. 

In addition to the standard scenario files based on these principles, it is standard actuarial practice to consider other plausible assumptions and demonstrate the sensitivity of our advice to other assumptions. To inform this, we also require the ability to generate additional scenarios based on alternative views and calibration parameters and/or carry out stress testing on the scenario set. 
GAD recognises that it may also be possible to procure access to an ""economic scenario model"" to provide the capability for GAD to produce the scenarios files described above ourselves. Due to current levels of capacity and capability, our preference is for the scenario sets to be provided to us based on calibration targets, adjustments and stresses that are discussed and agreed with the supplier. It is therefore essential that tenderers have the capability to deliver scenarios to us directly.

"GAD - 202104 - ESG",Contract,"Government Actuary Department",Awarded,2022-03-04T12:33:20Z,"Stochastic - Economic scenario generator","A key part of our advice relates to, or relies on, the potential outturns for key economic variables - in particular in relation to asset returns, inflation and future interest rates. To support our advice in this area, GAD are looking to tender for a contract for the provision of a set of stochastic economic scenarios (""scenarios"", ""scenario set"" or ""economic scenario file""). 

 The economic scenario file should contain stochastic forecasts of economic scenarios covering inflation, interest rates, credit, derivatives, FX and a range of asset classes. The scenarios are used in several areas of our advice, particularly for asset liability model runs for pension schemes, and are used to examine and illustrate the potential range of possible future outcomes. 

 We require that a set of scenarios be provided to us regularly, at least quarterly, over the period of the contract. We also required that the scenarios:
 i) are based on sound economic principles and methods; 
 ii) are calibrated to reflect the market and economic conditions at the effective date of the calibration to ensure consistency with the date at which they are used; and
 iii) are calibrated to reflect either the provider's own view or GAD's own house-view on the long-term outcome for key economic variables in the scenario set.

 GAD does not currently have a current provider of this service, though we have previously purchased one-off calibrations to support particular projects. 

 In addition to the standard scenario files based on these principles, it is standard actuarial practice to consider other plausible assumptions and demonstrate the sensitivity of our advice to other assumptions. To inform this, we also require the ability to generate additional scenarios based on alternative views and calibration parameters and/or carry out stress testing on the scenario set. 
 GAD recognises that it may also be possible to procure access to an ""economic scenario model"" to provide the capability for GAD to produce the scenarios files described above ourselves. Due to current levels of capacity and capability, our preference is for the scenario sets to be provided to us based on calibration targets, adjustments and stresses that are discussed and agreed with the supplier. It is therefore essential that tenderers have the capability to deliver scenarios to us directly. However, depending on the level of capacity and capability required to maintain and run such models ourselves, GAD are interested to explore this as an additional service and tenderers are invited to disclose such service provision in their response.

Brief Description of Requirement

There is a general shortage of rich data on equality outcomes for businesses in the UK. 
In particular, for this project, we are interested in aggregate indicators of business success for organisations with historically disadvantaged groups in the senior leadership team, including looking at intersectional outcomes.  
For example, what is the size and growth performance of majority women-led businesses?  What sectors do Chinese-led businesses tend to operate in?  What about the performance of businesses run by Black African women?
We are interested in looking at major ethnic groups separately, rather than treating them as a ""BME"" or ""BAME"" business.  This is as other information suggests that the  business outcomes and barriers vary widely by ethnic minority group, for example for cultural, geographical, class or historic reasons.
We are mainly interested in the for-profit sector in this project.

      The subcontract works will require the excavation of two areas of the former Ruislip Golf Course, Area B and Area E (as shown on the schematic drawings attached to this CompeteFor opportunity), which have been determined to have existing, significant archaeological potential (Mesolithic, Bronze Age and Medieval agricultural activity, and possible settlement) by previous archaeological trial trench evaluation. The method of archaeological mitigation will be 'Archaeological Recording' to investigate the heritage assets identified by trial trenching undertaken as part of HS2 Phase One Enabling Works Contract (EWC) for Area South.
      
      The subcontract works will also consist of the excavation of 47 no. 1.8m x 20m trenches across two areas of the former Ruislip Golf Course, Area D and Area F (as shown on the schematic drawings attached to this CompeteFor opportunity), which have not previously been subject to archaeological excavation. The strategy is designed to characterise the potential of the proposed development site by the excavation of 19 no. 1.8m x 30m trenches in Area D and 28 no. 1.8m x 30m trenches in Area F across the former Ruislip Golf Course. 
       Following responses to this opportunity, the supply chain will be shortlisted accordingly. Those that are successful will be invited to prequalify in order to receive a tender enquiry for the subcontract works. Prequalification will consist of 'business assurance', which will focus on the supply chain's capability, competence and capacity to work with SCS JV, as well as technical assurance which provides an opportunity to assess the supply chain's ability to carry out the subcontract works in question. Given that this has been classified as a 'high-risk' package, the 'business assurance' element of prequalification may be satisfied if the supply chain partner holds one of the Common Assessment Standard (CAS) accreditations, namely:
      
      - Achilles Building Confidence (with Desktop Audit),
      - Constructionline Gold, or
      - CHAS Premier (CAS).
      
      Further to a tender process, final selection will be based upon a balanced scorecard assessment. The criteria of this assessment will consider commercial, technical and qualitative (e.g. health and safety, quality, environment and sustainability, etc.) evidence provided by the tenderers. 
       SCS JV is an unincorporated joint venture between Skanska Construction UK Limited (""Skanska""), Costain Limited (""Costain"") and STRABAG AG (""STRABAG"") working on behalf of HS2 to deliver the main civil engineering works for the S1 and S2 sectors of HS2 Phase One. The Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) stage of the contract, where SCS JV was developing a scheme design, programme and target cost to deliver the detailed design and construction phase of the project, is now complete, whereby a Notice to Proceed to Stage Two (detailed design and construction) was issued on 15th April 2020. Not only have the individual companies delivered high-speed rail, major infrastructure and some of the most iconic structures internationally, SCS JV also has a proven record of working together. Skanska and Costain have a long history of successfully delivering civil engineering projects together in the UK, dating back 30 years. In joint venture they have delivered many major infrastructure projects, including the M25 in the 1980s, High Speed 1 in the early 2000s and the current Crossrail endeavour, shortly coming to completion under the streets of London. STRABAG and Skanska have worked together for over 15 years on European projects in Switzerland, Slovakia and Norway. As a joint venture, we are bringing together our collective strength to deliver world-class engineering, contributing to the long-term economic growth of local and international markets. This is perfectly encapsulated in our mission; to draw everyone together to create a strong foundation from which to launch a transformative legacy.

The ambition for the event is to embrace and utilise the creativity that already exists in Newham and to create a powerful, thought provoking and unique arts and cultural experience that reflects the vibrancy and diversity of borough and its communities. The aim is to create an event and activities programme where everyone can participate and actively get involved so as to draw more interest and footfall to Green Street over the weekend. Most of the events will take place outside or in well ventilated spaces.

The commission brief is to have as many live, interactive and experiential activities as possible. The programme could include some online content to allow as many people as possible to participate. The majority of the budget should be allocated to live events and activities to support the aims of the WBF.

As 2022 is the 10th anniversary of the Olympics and Paralympics, this event should acknowledge  this milestone through some of its programming. The event should capture the sense of belonging to the borough, helping to bring residents, shoppers and visitors together to celebrate the very best Newham has to offer. The two day event should be inclusive, inspire and encourage people to get involved, participate and enjoy all that will be on offer.

There is the opportunity for collaborative working between cultural organisations, and involve local businesses so they feel part of this two day programme. Both are actively encouraged and we are interested in proposals that will look to facilitate and progress these opportunities.",,"E13 3BA",,"79952000 ",,events@newham.gov.uk,"Building 1000,Dockside Road",,LONDON,E162QU,England,,https://www.newham.gov.uk/council/tender-opportunities,"Appendix 2_Specification.pdf ITT FINAL_Green Street Two Day Half Term Event_Update.docx ",,,22/12/2021,04/03/2022,17/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,70000,95000,05/01/2022,93233.8,"[Applecartlive Ltd|170 Harold Road

Through this procurement activity, GBSLEP is seeking a provider to be able to fulfil one of three primary strands of project activity that contributes to the overall outputs and outcomes of the programme.

The project is required to deliver 20 no. no_code developed MVPs capable of launching into the market for new Founders/early-stage businesses  in the disruptive professional services technology arena encompassing fintech, HR-tech, legaltech, proptech and requires holistic support to manage founders through to MVP stage. 

The underpinning rationale for this intervention is to address critical needs of our region, which include:

- high barriers to entry for digital start-ups;

- high risk associated with new start-up ventures and the benefits of failing faster with lower upfront investment; and

- lack of inclusivity of the founder experience in key sectors such as fintech, where the average age of a founder is 48 in West Midlands, as well as being white, male and middle class.

As such, this project is fundamentally focused on democratizing the founder experience and levelling the playing field within the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

At present, the Requirement is delivered through the two existing Traffic Control Systems Contracts.  These contracts have been in place since 2017 and are currently due to expire in April 2022.  While these have been successful contracts, SCC recognise that there is an opportunity to build upon these successes and take steps to maximise the opportunities available to both the Council and the appointed supplier.
      
      The Council operate and maintain approximately 800 intelligent transport assets, comprising of signal-controlled junctions, signal-controlled crossings, Fire Station Wig-wags, car park equipment, variable message signs, rising bollards and C.C.T.V. cameras.
      
      The Council operates a whole life asset management programme and is currently expecting to spend approximately £5,000,000.00 per annum on its intelligent transport systems.
      
      In order to maximise the success of this contract, the Council will need to put in place a contract which provides the appointed supplier with further opportunities to deliver innovative services which may change the way in which the contract is delivered in the future. SCC therefore plan to encourage the successful bidder to work together with the Council and its partner organisations to innovate and enable the results to be implemented.  For example, the Council are currently considering how greater use of technology may improve service delivery, how other services can be delivered in an innovative way via the appointed supplier and putting in place a mechanism which encourages the supplier to approach the Council with new ideas which can actually be implemented.",,"RH2 8EF","Any region","34923000 34996100 45233294 45316212 50232000 63712700 ","Robert Davis",robert.davis@surreycc.gov.uk,"Woodhatch Place, 11 Cockshot Hill",", ,",Reigate,"RH2 8EF","UNITED KINGDOM","0208 541 9000",,,"https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/Account/Login?cid=surreycc ",,01/04/2022,31/03/2028,20/09/2021,NO,,No,No,No,Services,50000000,,05/01/2022,35045565,"[Siemens Mobility Limited|Siemens Mobility Limited, Sopers Lane, Poole, Dorset, BH17 7ER, UNITED KINGDOM|COMPANIES_HOUSE|00016033|No|No]",,01/04/2022,31/03/2028,"OpenOJEU ",,00:00

The sites are primarily located in the former coalfield area to the west and north of the County, although there are a small number of sites through the central belt of Nottinghamshire and also to the south and east of the city of Nottingham.

These sites are, in the main, restored colliery spoil heaps, disused mineral railway lines (now used as multi-user routes) and other land managed as informal green space principally for public recreation and biodiversity. Land use on these sites includes amenity woodland, conservation grassland, wetland, commercial forestry and some agricultural pasture.

As a result, the Green Spaces service manage a significant tree and woodland resource, with our tree stock located alongside the public highway, definitive rights of way, active railway lines, and residential and industrial property, in addition to the many miles of informal paths, tracks and trails that cross our sites. As a responsible landowner, we wish to ensure that these trees do not pose an unacceptable risk to the public.

We are therefore seeking a cost-effective and efficient 'duty of care' survey of the trees on up to 42no. of our Green Spaces sites and are inviting quotes to this end.

Brief Description of Requirement

The UK Space Agency (UKSA) and sector partners have led and commissioned several impact evaluations of Space Science Programme activity over recent years, each contributing to the sector's evidence base and demonstrating the benefits that accrue from investments in this area. The core competencies and expertise of the UK space science research base are relatively well known (in terms of science disciplines and technology/engineering specialisms), however little in depth research has been undertaken to capture the underlying conditions that enable this impact or underpin these competencies, nor the future direction of space science disciplines at a long term, international level. 
The overarching aim of this research is to: 
1.	Build UKSA's intelligence on the source(s) of the UK's strengths in space science, thereby pinpointing the factors that need to be developed and maintained to remain competitive and identifying any weaknesses that could impact on the sustainability of the UK's competitiveness. 
2.	At a more macro level, the research should also encompass factors (opportunities and threats) beyond the immediate UK sector itself, considering for example broader political and economic conditions, government policy, international collaboration, and competition
3.	Possible pathways that space science will develop in the mid to long term (e.g., 20-30 years)
4.	Determine scope within the sector to align with ESAs Voyage 2050 programme 
5.	Scope for potential future bilateral relationships in space science

This research will provide insights that shape the development of the strategy underpinning objectives and investment decisions of the existing UKSA national space science programme and its possible future augmentation.

The aim is to shift from more to less polluting fuels, i.e. from wet wood to dry wood, and from traditional house coal to low sulphur manufactured solid fuels. The supply of traditional house coal and wet wood sold in units under 2m³ is being phased out between 2021 and 2023. Sulphur and smoke emission limits have been introduced for manufactured solid fuels. We are aware that new fuels, such as coffee logs, are entering the market. As stated in the Clean Air Strategy, the government wants to encourage innovation, but customers need to be certain that these products are safe to use and no testing standard currently exists. Further research is needed to consider the most appropriate standard for these products to ensure that health and environmental impacts are minimised. Government intends to review these fuels with a view to setting relevant standards. Currently, these fuels are exempt from the new requirements, and may continue to be sold outside Smoke Control Areas. This project is a first step in the review of these new and emerging fuels. We want to find out the size of the market for coffee logs and other emerging waste-based fuels, and how this is responding to the recently introduced new requirements. This will help us to decide the scale of the issue, and whether it is proportionate to commission further research into emissions from these fuels with a view to introducing appropriate regulations. We are aware that, since the new measures were introduced, lignite is starting be sold as a fuel for domestic burning. The new requirements do not apply to lignite, and concerns have been raised that this is a highly polluting form of coal. We are also looking for information about the size of the market and its response to the new requirements for this fuel, and any other emerging fuels such as pet coke to see whether research and possible new standards is proportionate",,,London,"73000000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"20220120 final Ricardo Contract - Market study REDACTED_Redacted.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,13/01/2022,31/03/2022,10/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,07/01/2022,59559,"[Ricardo-AEA Ltd|The Gemini Building, Harwell, Oxfordshire, OX11 0QR, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,13/01/2022,31/03/2022,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

In support of the BLMK ICS strategic priorities, the Shared Health and Care Record programme, the BLMK Population Health Management Programme, BLMK Data Strategy and the recent BLMK CCG Business Intelligence and Data Analytics Warehouse Procurement there is a requirement to bring together an BLMK ICS wide Digital Strategy to serve the needs of all organisations and our residents in the provision of access to clean, consistent and comprehensive data.  

The drive for a significant patient care, patient self-care and predictive analytics / intelligence is based on recognition that the current landscape of technologies and interfaces across BLMK is largely fragmented, silo'd and with significant elements of necessary capability remaining isolated - for example, each organisation has taken its own approach to core systems that meet organisational need without System consideration.

Therefore there was a requirement to procure a provider to support development of a BLMK ICS Digital Strategy to meet its digital ambitions and support each of our organisations though subsidiarity.

The purpose of the training is to upskill key members and officers within the Council in carbon literacy.

The training provider may wish to use the Carbon Literacy Project toolkits for local authorities and adapt them and make them specific to Essex prior to any delivery. There are three toolkits available, one for Council officers, one for leaders and managers and one for elected members.

•	How climate here and elsewhere is likely to change, and how we know this.
•	How changes in the climate are likely to affect us in the UK (particularly in Essex) and in other parts of the world.
•	What greenhouse gases are, their main sources, and their relationship to weather and climate. 
•	How our actions impact the amount of greenhouse gases produced and the impact that they have.

What we can do to help address climate change: 
•	What we can do to reduce our contribution to climate change and where can we get help 
•	What is the issue and what is Essex County Council doing about it
•	What can residents, educational establishments and businesses do to tackle climate change.

Further to the previous publication of a voluntary ex ante transparency notice (on the Find a Tender Service - 2021/S 000-032261 and on Contracts Finder), and completion of the 10 day standstill period (that concluded on 4th January 2022), NHS Brighton & Hove Clinical Commissioning Group, NHS West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group, and NHS East Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group (the Sussex CCGs) have awarded a contract for a period of 14 months and 3 weeks to Care Unbound Ltd t/a HERE for the provision of a Primary Care Escalation Framework (PCEF) Service commencing on 10th January 2022.
The Sussex CCGs reserve the right to extend the contract by up to a further 12 months.
The PCEF is a programme of work the CCG has commissioned through a collaboration of Improved Access Service (IAS) providers who the CCG consider to be best placed to roll out the PCEF rapidly, at scale to respond to the on-going and escalating requirements from primary care of the Covid 19 pandemic and winter pressures while ensuring the stability of general practice in Sussex. The PCEF is a framework to demonstrate live resilience of primary care services at practice, primary care network, place, and system level to then coordinate an appropriate and timely response.

The Primary Care Escalation Framework (PCEF) will dovetail with wider ICS winter escalation framework which in turn is based on the NHS England, Southeast framework, NHS England OPEL (Operational Pressures Escalation) Framework October-2018. The current OPEL framework has focussed more on the visibility of the demand and pressure in acute and community services. The PCEF aims to address this by introducing a parallel system within primary care to ensure visibility across the whole health and care system in Sussex.

In relation to the proposals for the implementation of the primary care escalation framework breaks down into three phases:

-Phase one - Data Survey Collection Survey initiation across all Sussex Practices - to establish resilience needs.
Data warehouse, (incl helpdesk & technical support) & dashboard development.

-Phase two - Escalation Framework Liaison.
Regional Liaison with Primary Care.

-Phase three - Resilience Response Design.
Regional co-ordination and collation of resilience plans and emerging needs - including workshops to bring together regional learning and finalise re-design options appraisal.

This will be a prime provider contract delivered by Here who will then sub-contract with all Improved Access Services (IAS) in Sussex for the delivery of phases two and three of the programme, to utilise and build on existing relationships and geographical frameworks.",,,"South East","79430000 ","Chris McCarthy",christopher.mccarthy@soeprocurement.nhs.uk,"Unit 8, Manor Court, Barnes Wallis Rd, Segensworth",,FAREHAM,"PO15 5TH",England,,,"Award Explanation.docx ",,"The value stated includes the total potential amount in the event the contract was to be extended by the optional further 12 months

      The Council will be acting as lead Authority and managing the procurement process for both Authorities. The successful Applicant will enter into two contracts, one with the Council and one with NFRA.
      
      In summary the systems to be replaced are the Communications and Control System (ICCS) and the Command and Control/Dispatch System (CAD).
      
      WFRS and NFRS require a cloud based command and control mobilising system (with integrated ICCS/CAD functionality) that allows for inter-operability, for service wide deployment, through a mobile and web-based version. WFRS and NFRS are seeking a flexible portable system that can be used from multiple secure sites.  
      
      The solution delivered will allow for inter-operability with WFRS & NFRS.  The inter-operable solution will provide separate instances for each services with access to each others.  If either service terminates its agreement with the Supplier, the remaining service should not be able to access the separate data of the departing customer.
      
      For both WFRS and NFRS the systems need to be fully live by the end of 2022, preferably with the ICCS element going live first (if this is possible). 
      
      To ensure that the system procured meets expectations  NFRS/WFRS are committed to getting the best possible system to suit its needs whilst ensuring that any system will be fully ESN compliant.
      
      The available combined budget envelope for the joint system is estimated as being £2.2m for the 5 years to £2.5m over the whole contract period i.e. 7 years with upper end of the budget looking for a solution that exceeds our requirements and provides operational efficiencies.  This provides an individual budget for each Service of c £1.1m over 5yrs (incl maintenance & support), and £1.25m over 7yr period.
      Please refer to the Clarification Log for further details.
      
      Bids that exceed these budgetary ranges may be disqualified from the procurement process. The Council and NFRA also reserve the right to only award a contract for one service if a bid exceeds a services capital budget element.

KENT001-DN586740-71203662,Contract,"Kent County Council",Awarded,2022-01-05T10:54:55Z,"Reconnect - Improving Work Experience","Kent County Council is looking to procure a service that meets the objectives of the Economic Wellbeing Theme within the Reconnect Programme, as stated below. 
Work Experience (WEX) declined dramatically over the Covid period and is still very limited as most companies are focussing on getting back on their feet not on supporting the community. Young people are often ill prepared for work experience and do not fully benefit from the opportunities. To mitigate the detrimental effects of Covid this needs to be improved. We wish to procure a project that improves the quality and quantity of work experience in schools. 
Aims: To build capacity in education by providing CPD and ongoing support to schools to develop their delivery of Work Experience. This will be linked to the Ofsted inspection framework and support the delivery of the Personal Development strand in schools. To provide young people training opportunities on how to prepare for WEX and maximise its benefits. To provide access for young people to a range of online and real world WEX opportunities in a supported way. To promote the benefits of Work Experience to Kent businesses. 
Details: Timescales - To start ASAP and continue for the maximum allowed period (31 August 2022). Much of the support would remain beyond this in the form of training materials, webinars etc remaining available online. Location - countywide. Mainly virtual with some in person opportunities. 
Delivery model, including number of students/institutions impacted We envisage two tiers of support, one intensive and one more self-directed. There will also be a need for some specialist support for vulnerable learners in schools and those not in education: Tier 1 - direct support to schools and access to real world placements Approximately 15 Mainstream Schools,5 special schools Tier 2 - 30 schools minimum Access to online/face to face training package and resources covering preparation for work experience, maximising the benefits, embedding in a school. Access to online and face to face work experience opportunities for students. Specialist Support Vulnerable learners often require additional support. We would like suppliers to offer additional direct support to these young people: Additional support for vulnerable learners in special schools in tier 1 and 2 - including interviews and preparation sessions to ensure they succeed in placements. 300 places for vulnerable students countywide for vulnerable students approaching the project directly. They will require support to find placements, prepare for them and maximise benefits",,,"South East","80530000 ","Colin Jones",colin.jones@kent.gov.uk,"Sessions House",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,10/01/2022,31/08/2022,15/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,50000,70000,04/01/2022,70000,"[EBP Kent|Kent Innovation Centre
