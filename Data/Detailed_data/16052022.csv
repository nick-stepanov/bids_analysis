Imported trees should spend at least one full growing season on a UK nursery, with all trees provided being subjected to a full pest and disease control programme, tested for physiological health and regular DEFRA inspection before they are planted in the UK landscape. 

Evidence of this control programme, together with a comprehensive audit trail of when the imported trees were received and how long they have been on the nursery, should be available. This audit trail should allow for a full recall in the event that any pest and or disease problems may subsequently manifest themselves in the landscape.

This is a new competitive procurement process using an open procedure conducted in accordance with the light touch regime of the Public Procurement 2015 Regulations. The objective of the procurement process is to retender the areas within Nottinghamshire where a contract was not awarded during the procurement that was undertaken in 2021:16+ Services - Young people supported accommodation and tenancy support, DN562021.
The following groups of young people are eligible to access 16 plus supported accommodation:
•	Looked After Children moving on from residential care or foster care as part of a planned move or following a placement breakdown
•	Care Leavers up to the age of 25
•	Homeless and vulnerably housed 16/17-year olds 
•	Homeless and vulnerably housed 18-21-year olds with additional other vulnerabilities 
Nottinghamshire Council is looking to continue to drive service improvements and achieve improved outcomes for young people by redesigning the 16+ supported accommodation services.  Currently services are commissioned via two routes: a framework agreement that was established in 2015 and which is due to end in July 2022, and an approved provider list established in 2018 for young people with more challenging behaviours or high-risk profiles that are unsuitable for the main provision.  These existing contracts and individual placement agreements will draw to a close and be replaced by a new supported accommodation suite of services. The scope and nature of the services required by the Council are set out in more detail in the Specification.  The service is required across the South (Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushcliffe) and the Mansfield and Ashfield district areas of Nottinghamshire County and will be commissioned as 7 separate lots as follows:
		Lot 1 Broxtowe, Rushcliffe and Gedling - Solo and Core Plus
		Lot 2 Broxtowe, Rushcliffe and Gedling - Core
		Lot 3 Broxtowe, Rushcliffe and Gedling - Cluster and Tenancy Support
		Lot 4 Mansfield - Solo and Core Plus
		Lot 5 Mansfield Core, Cluster and Tenancy Support
		Lot 6 Ashfield - Solo and Core Plus 
		Lot 7 Ashfield - Core, Cluster and Tenancy Support
There is no limit on how many Lots Providers can bid for, and Providers should bid for all lots they have the capacity to deliver.
The contract will commence on 01 August 2022 for a period of 5 years to 31 July 2027. There are 3 twenty-four-month extensions available.

No more than two contracts will be awarded to any one provider or consortium, unless there is not a viable alternative bid in which case the Council may award a third contract to one provider/consortia.  If the situation arises where one provider/consortia is the highest scoring bidder on more than the maximum contracts, the Council will use its discretion to determine which two contracts will be offered to them.    

Bids submitted on behalf of a group for example a consortium will be accepted.

The Drinking Water Inspectorate published guidance on the use of UV irradiation for the disinfection of public water supplies in 2010, and this guidance was reviewed and updated in 2016.

The guidance and validation standard is intended for use primarily by public and private water suppliers within the UK. The current guidance document provides information on the design, operation and monitoring of UV irradiation as a process for the disinfection of public water supplies intended for domestic or food production purposes. The guidance may also be appropriate to the disinfection of waters analogous to public water supplies, such as unregulated or private water supplies.

The objectives are:
1.	Conduct a review of current US and European validation standards and verification techniques. Search the grey and published literature for up to date evidence on the use of UV irradiation for the disinfection of public and private water supplies, including an evaluation of good operational practice.
2.	Develop a prospective UK validation standard that can be used when installing small or large UV disinfection systems (public and private water supplies).
3.	Amend the current DWI guidance, to maintain up to date technical relevance and ensure that the guidance is consistent and fit for purpose.",,"SW1P 3JR",London,"31515000 41110000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Redacted Contract_Dev of a UK Verification Std and Guidance for UV Irradiation Disinfection of Drinking.pdf ","https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,27/06/2022,27/01/2023,27/04/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,0,13/05/2022,80625,"[University of Brighton|Mithras House, Brighton, East Sussex, BN2 4AT, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,27/06/2022,27/01/2023,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

Defra is seeking to understand the evidence more fully on:
1.	The current use of heritage and dual-purpose cattle in UK farming systems and the reasoning for holding these breeds (e.g., environmental, cultural, suitability to management system or input levels, climate etc.).
2.	Efficiency and productivity compared between conventional and heritage/dual-purpose breeds as well as within heritage/dual-purpose breeds, accounting for costs of production.
3.	How well do current productivity models reflect heritage/dual-purpose breeds?
4.	The levels of GHG emissions per measure of product and land for these breeds when compared to conventional breeds.
5.	The potential for increasing the use of heritage/dual-purpose cattle in extensive and intensive farming systems, mentioning benefits and trade-offs.

Brief Description of Requirement
Prospering from the Energy Revolution (PFER)  is one of UK Research and Innovation's Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund programmes. Delivered by Innovate UK (part of UKRI), it is investing around £104 million, matched by industry, to help businesses, researchers and local communities develop, test and prove smart local energy systems. There are over 50 projects in the programme, ranging from small feasibility studies to large-scale demonstrators.
The programme portfolio booklet https://www.ukri.org/publications/smart-local-energy-systems-the-energy-revolution-takes-shape/ describes the aims of the programme, and the aims, locations, funding, and partners of the projects.
The programme has been running since 2018. Many of the smaller and earlier projects have already completed. Others will cease to be funded at different points during 2022 and early 2023, with all PFER funding ending by March 2023. 
This request for quote is for researching and writing four key publications to be produced during 2022, to communicate the outcomes, insights and learnings from the portfolio of projects as the programme nears its close.",,,"United Kingdom","71314300 ","Kerry Hart",coreservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House,North Star Avenue",,SWINDON,SN21FF,England,"01793 867005",www.uksbs.co.uk,,,,10/05/2022,30/11/2022,13/04/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,42750,,10/05/2022,42750,"[REGEN SW|Castle Street Ground Floor Bradninch Court

      This includes:
      o Daily Mile trail marker design and installation
      o Daily Mile markings
      o Placards
      This work will be undertaken in partnership with Public Health, Parks and the City of Nature Alliance (https://naturallybirmingham.org/birmingham-city-of-nature-alliance/) delivering health and wellbeing programming in local parks and green spaces.  
      
      The Parks where Daily Mile Tracks are to be installed are as below:
      o Ladywood - Summerfield Park
      o Handsworth - Handsworth Park
      o Nechells- Bloomsbury Park
      o Castle Vale - Farnborough Drive
      o Aston - Philip St
      o Balsall Heath West - Calthorpe Park
      o Balsall Heath West -Balsall Heath POS
      o Gravelly Hill - The Oval
      o Pype Hayes - Pype Hayes Park
      o Bordesley and Highgate - Highgate Park
      The successful provider will need to engage with the local communities and target groups (e.g religious groups/faith-based organisations) by encouraging them to use the Daily Mile Tracks as part of their weekly physical activity. 
      
      All daily miles' installations should be completed by August 2022. The Provider will need to have a mechanism in place to measure number of users of the Daily Mile in each of the locations. The Provider will be expected to collate community use data until end of February 2023.

More than half of parents (56%) who used formal childcare before Covid-19 reported that the overall disruption to schools and childcare settings since March 2020 has harmed their child's social and educational development .

Evidence tells us that the quality of education and care in early years has the biggest impact on children's outcomes within a childcare setting. As such, we have designed a recovery programme for early years focused on supporting practitioners and leaders, who are key to addressing the impact of the pandemic on the youngest children.

One of the ways the Department for Education (DfE) is supporting early years settings is through a targeted continuous professional development (CPD) offer and focus on high quality qualifications. As part of this, DfE is conducting a review of the Level 3 qualification, including the criteria.

The Early Years Educator (EYE) Level 3 criteria are the criteria reflected in L3 EY qualifications. If the DfE assesses that a qualification meets the L3 criteria, then it can be considered ""full and relevant"" and added to the Early Years Qualifications List (EYQL) - meaning that holders of this qualification can count as qualified members of staff, and can work within the Level 3 staff:child ratios in England.

This project as a whole seeks to improve the quality and rigour of the L3 early years qualification, including the criteria, through consultation and engagement with stakeholders and users, and rigorous analysis of new and available data, thereby strengthening its quality and evidence-base. Our intention is for the review to take into account both the L3 criteria and its delivery.

The service will provide proactive and reactive emotional and practical support for patients with an eye condition and their carers.  This will include outpatient support, inpatient support to the care of the elderly (COTE) wards and community support within the Forest of Dean.

Access to appropriate support and information at the point of diagnosis is denied to many visually impaired people largely through difficulties in accessing information, mobility and knowledge of their rights. The ECLO service aims to ensure these barriers are overcome.  

The ECLO service is a key component to ensuring that each person receives appropriate emotional and practical support, information and services, at the earliest opportunity. Offering this service is an integral part of the patient journey from ophthalmology to social care and community support.

Each element of the service will be fully integrated with the patient pathway and will work closely with both hospital and community staff to undertake the following:

	Providing Emotional support
	Information-giving / signposting  
	Advocacy
	Identification of need
	Development of Referrals pathways, professional relationships/networks
	Information and Education on Certification and registration
	Monitoring and follow up of patient progress  
	Input into MDT 
	Daily living skills and sighted guiding
	Record keeping
	Evaluation and impact measurement

Please note the contract value stated on this advert is for the initial 3-year contract period and should be considered as an indicative figure.

NHS Gloucestershire CCG expects that the service provided will represent value for money.  The cost envelope range for the delivery of these services is £90,000 to £100,000 per annum (£270,000 to £300,000 for the initial 3-year contract period).

Central to this vision is a commitment to equality of opportunity to serve Hounslow's diverse residents and communities in the best way possible.

The Pilot for the Green Skills Academy will rely on the Skills Escalator programme. Previously, this model has been used to tailor programmes to individual residents, but through the pilot will now aim to give 100 Hounslow Residents access to a Domestic Energy Assessor (DEA) Course and Qualification.

The course has been chosen due to a significant demand for DEA qualified professionals, good career progressions into retrofitting or other energy-related services, and flexibility to choose self-employment upon course completion. Furthermore, it requires no pre-existing knowledge in the field, nor a high level of digital or English skills, ensuring that the course is accessible to a large proportion of Hounslow's population.

The residents targeted by the programme have been financially impacted by Covid-19, either through prolonged periods on the furlough programme, or through unemployment. The participants must be over 19 and present payslips or other evidence that they have been negatively impacted and they must be Hounslow residents.",,,England,"80400000 80500000 ",,tracey.williams@hounslow.gov.uk,"Hounslow House","Bath Road, Hounslow",London,"TW3 3EB",England,,,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=15aea8ed-4775-ec11-8110-005056b64545 ",,01/06/2022,31/05/2024,15/03/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,100000,100000,11/05/2022,100000,"[Elmhurst Energy Services Ltd|LE17 4HB|NONE||Yes|No]",,01/06/2022,31/05/2024,"Open ",,13:00

The evaluation will assess the impact of the PRS on organisations who participated, as well as its wider impact in the sector. 
      
      (Background: The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport commissioned an ongoing process evaluation of the scheme implementation and a final report was received in December 2021. This does not evaluate the contribution of the PRS to target outcomes or impacts, nor the appropriateness of each element of the eligibility criteria. However, it does provide recommendations on the scope and design of an impact evaluation based on findings from primary research in the process evaluation work. The findings of the report have been incorporated into this invitation to tender. The final report will be made available to the successful contractor to support work on the impact evaluation.)
      
      We expect the evaluation approach to cover two distinct elements: 
      
      1. An impact evaluation, to understand whether the PRS has resulted in the desired outcomes and whether it has had any unintended (positive or negative) consequences; and
      2. An economic evaluation, to measure and monetise the programme impacts (if appropriate) relative to its costs to assess the extent to which it represents value for money.

Preferred Options for the Local Plan (called the First Proposals) were published for public consultation in November 2021 with a supporting evidence base.

The Councils consider that the employment land, economic development and housing needs evidence completed to date (referred to below) is robust. The work now required to support future stages of plan making goes beyond what was envisaged in the original contract, reflecting changing circumstances in both the plan making process, including additional plan making stages, and the context in which the plan is being prepared, including the COVID-19 pandemic. As such this new procurement exercise seeks to incorporate all requirements now anticipated through to adoption of the Greater Cambridge Local Plan, any further support needed to inform the latter stages of North East Cambridge Area Action Plan, and also to incorporate the potential for advice on related topics. The successful company will need to provide advice in a way that updates and builds upon work completed and published to date, as well as responding to consultation representations made at all stages of the plan making process regarding that work. 

The project specification includes a number of work strands:

•	Work-strand 1: Work to inform Greater Cambridge Local Plan Draft Plan (Regulation 18) consultation:
o	Review of Greater Cambridge Employment Land and Economic Development Evidence Study
o	Review of Housing & Employment Relationships Report
o	Economic development advice on issues relating to strategic allocations proposed in Local Plan

•	Work-strand 2: North East Cambridge advice 

•	Work-strand 3: Work to inform future stages of plan-making

•	Work-strand 4: Provision of Expert advice to Development Plan Examinations

OXFS001-DN597433-93110195,Contract,"Oxfordshire County Council",Awarded,2022-05-12T14:25:44+01:00,"Contract for the Provision of Services for Healthy Weight Support for Children in Oxfordshire","Oxfordshire County Council has awarded a contract following an open tender process for an initial pilot approach for a new Tier 2 healthy weight management service for children and their families in Oxfordshire. This will enable the Council to test and learn what works well and not so well in different areas across Oxfordshire and with different communities to inform future commissioning.

The Council invited tenders from providers to pilot the delivery of group and 1-1 support at Tier 2 for children and families across all 5 districts in Oxfordshire, but with a focus on the greatest areas of inequality and excess weight. Working with partners to provide a streamlined pathway of care between Tier 1-4 will be paramount to this offer.

Reducing obesity is a priority public health issue for Oxfordshire. The Health Improvement Board (HIB) oversees the Whole Systems Approach (WSA) to healthy weight, which involves system partners working together to deliver a range of initiatives to increase the number of adults, children and families who are a healthy weight in Oxfordshire. Reducing health inequalities by working with disadvantaged communities and individuals is integral to this approach.

The provision of tier 2 weight management services for children and their families will contribute to the WSA and close a gap in healthy weight support for children who are identified as very overweight or obese following national childhood measurement programme (NCMP) or otherwise.

Tenderers were invited to tender for the provision for a term of 18 Months with an option for the Council to extend for up to 12 Months originally anticipated to commence on 1 May 2022.

As the impact of the COVID pandemic remains broadly unknown and as recovery was expected to be very different in each sector and community, Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council put in place a Renewal Action Plan for Barnsley; taking a coordinated approach to support businesses to recover from COVID-19.  Within that Action Plan, the Council has approved funding for their Employment and Skills service to design and develop a bespoke programme of support for local businesses - to help them maximise the productivity of their workforce as we progress through this current period of recovery. 

Eligible businesses will undergo a diagnostic assessment with the first consultant to work through the key issues affecting their workforce.  Following the assessment, each business will have their own action plan with priorities for further work that will be designed against 1 or more of the 5 areas outlined below:
•	Organisational Human Resources
•	Leadership and Management
•	Workforce Mapping 
•	Workforce Development and Culture
•	Employee Mental Health
The specialist providers will deliver against the action plan to facilitate a range of training workshops and/or meetings to enable the businesses to reassess and improve their workforce productivity.  
This project is one of seven Prioritised Recovery Projects, part of a £2 million economic investment, funded by Barnsley Council and South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority. As part of Barnsley's Economic Recovery Action Plan, these projects will help the local economy bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The programme aims to support people, businesses, traders, charities or community organisations to safeguard existing jobs while creating new jobs and business opportunities",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","66170000 66171000 71600000 71621000 73200000 73210000 73220000 79000000 79400000 79410000 79411000 79411100 79412000 79413000 79414000 79419000 80500000 80510000 80511000 80532000 80561000 80570000 ","Mira Hope",procurement@barnsley.gov.uk,"Town Hall",,"Barnsley, South Yorkshire","S70 2TA",ENG,"'+44 1226772752",https://www.barnsley.gov.uk,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=43350&B=UK https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/103835 ",,04/04/2022,30/09/2022,07/03/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1,382500,11/05/2022,350000,"[Black Kat HR|Digital Media Centre (DMC01, County Way, Barnsley S70 2JW|NONE||No|No][Brook Corporate Development|Unit 7 & 8, The Business Village, Innovation Way, Barnsley S75 1JL|NONE||No|No][Centric HR|Hawkes yard Hall, Armitage Ln, Rugeley WS15 1PU|NONE||No|No][Optima UK Inc|2 Smith Way, Grove Park, Enderby,

NICA were Advisory Board members to the All Parliamentary Group for Longevity, which launched the Health of the Nation: A Strategy for Healthier Longer Lives (February 2020).

Longevity economies are not just about existing markets further developing to meet the needs of current ""older people"". They are also not just about products and services for independent living, or for older people's health and social care. Instead, the opportunity is much bigger. It is about through-life health and wellbeing, and investment in products and services that are essential in early and mid-life, to enable residents to enjoy longer, productive, healthier lives.

The CAV site as a whole will require £500m investment from both the public and private sector. The University will work with its principal development partner to develop a detailed commercial model for the site which will include identification of appropriate income sources to ensure the site is self-sustaining.

The White Paper intrinsically recognises the requirement for adoption of a population health approach aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of local populations and reducing health inequalities. The CQC will be responsible for assessing ICS's progress.

The National Universal Healthcare Network (NUHN) consists of a membership of senior NHS Leaders, Community and Think Leaders from across the country. It mobilised in Sept 2021 to house attention to a specific issue, (Universal Healthcare) and potential approach to address it, which was not deemed to be taking place anywhere else. This is evidenced by the relationship established with the National Healthcare Inequalities Improvement Programme, which has committed to be part of the oversight infrastructure for the work.

The NUHN is unique in the range of expertise it brings together which resulted in 3 clear provocations on Universal Healthcare which are not being addressed by the mainstream inequalities agenda, or the NHSE Core20Plus Collaborative or High Impact Improvement Network.

The CEOs of West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership (HCP) and Sussex HCP consider this proposal as a lever, (amongst others) to achieving progress against this ambition at pace.
This will involve a process of data mining, designing and rapidly testing innovations with local communities (prototyping), catalysing culture change  through by learning together across the Community of Practices established for this work, (West Yorkshire HCP and Sussex HCPs) and 'checking and challenging' the dominant narrative that shapes the context for the NHS's work on Universal Healthcare by bringing the learning from the Communities of Practices into a national context, (UHN) and NHSE/I to inform policy and practice.
