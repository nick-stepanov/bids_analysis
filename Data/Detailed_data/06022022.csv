•	Survey One on environment, including storm overflows (causing sewage in rivers)

There has been recent coverage on, and public concern about, the release of sewage into rivers by wastewater companies. This survey is to understand people's levels of awareness, concern, and trust in relation to the release of sewage into rivers. It should also cover wider environmental questions that relate to river quality - such as wet wipes and microplastics. The survey will be used to monitor changing views and preferences over time. 

Timeframe: 
We expect the first wave of this survey to be run and reported on between January-March 2022. We expect this survey will be repeated in 2022 and/or 2023.

•	Survey Two on value for money / cost of living

Many customers are likely to face increased financial pressures over the next year. Costs of living are expected to rise - with rising energy bills, an increase to national insurance, and a rise in inflation. 

Water bills are also expected to rise for many customers. We are looking to monitor perceptions of water company bills over time.

The research should include questions on awareness of current cost of water and other utility bills, whether water and utility bills are seen to offer value for money, understanding of what water bills include (and whether perceptions on value for money changes when information is provided on this), and trust in companies.

Timeframe:
We expect the first wave of this survey to be run and reported on between January-March 2022, and to be repeated in 2022 and/or 2023.

•	Other surveys 

We expect to use the Contract to commission other surveys of interest to Ofwat. Some of these surveys may be emerging issues that are specific to a particular location (for example, if there is particular flooding or water shortages in a particular part of England and Wales). We may also seek to commission surveys at fairly short notice.

The BTPA's keystone document is its Code of Governance which defines the split of roles, powers, rights and responsibilities between the BTPA, its Executive Team and the Chief Constable and senior leaders of BTP.

Following a large-scale review of governance arrangements in 2015/16, the Code of Governance was significantly updated in 2017, with only minor updates since. The Service Level Agreement and financial annexes were, however, largely unchanged during the 2017 review and are now in need of modernisation, such that they are an enabler in how the BTPA and BTP work effectively together. The objective being to ensure sufficient clarity of roles whilst demonstrating transparency and trust and providing empowerment.
The Authority is looking for consultancy advice and support to provide clarity on and modernise these documents and, in turn, the ways of working between BTPA and BTP.
For the purposes of this RFQ exercise the work has been split into two lots.

The overarching objectives of the services are to reduce the harm linked to substance misuse and to enable more people to achieve and sustain recovery from substance misuse.
      
      Services will be delivered under two lots;
      
      - Lot 1: Substance misuse harm reduction and treatment (element 1) & substance misuse supported housing service (element 2)
      
      - Lot 2: Substance misuse independent peer-led service (element 3)
      
      Providers can bid for both lots but can only be awarded one. Where bidding for both providers must state what their preference would be if they are selected as preferred bidder for both lots. Through separating the substance misuse independent peer-led service we aim to establish a truly independent service which empowers service users and increases service user involvement.
      
      Providers have the option to either deliver services from the current properties or to propose use of their own properties, the latter will be deemed a variant bid.
      
      The council is targeting to have awarded both contracts on 1 Feb 2022 to allow for service commencement on 1 June 2022. The contracts will be let for an initial term of 46 months which may then run for a further 6 years in increments set by the Council to a total maximum term of 9 years and 10 months, subject to performance and at the sole option of the Council.
      
      The estimated total value of lot 1 is IRO IRO £4,003,793 pa, £15,347,873 over the 46 month initial term. This is based on the current funding for the services.
      
      The estimated value of lot 2 is IRO £250,000 pa, £958,333 over the 46 month initial term. This is based on the current funding for the services.
      
      The annual value of both contracts is expected to vary over the initial 46 months due to a combination of secure and unsecure funding streams. The total value of the contract opportunity for this initial period is IRO £16,306,206. The estimated value of the contract over the maximum term of 9 years and 10 months is IRO £30.12m - £52.2m allowing for further additional funding should the become available.",,"PO1 2BJ","South East","85000000 85312000 85100000 85312500 85312300 85140000 85311000 85323000 85312400 ","Procurement Service",procurement@portsmouthcc.gov.uk,"Guildhall Square",Portsmouth,Hampshire,"PO1 2BJ","United Kingdom","023 9268 8235",,,,,01/06/2022,31/03/2026,10/12/2021,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,30120000,52200000,01/02/2022,0,"[Pushing Change|67 Kingston Road, 67 Kingston Road, Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hampshire, United Kingdom, PO2 7DX|NONE||No|No][The Society of St James|125, Albert Road South, Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom, SO14 3FR|NONE||No|No]",,01/06/2022,31/03/2026,"Open ",,12:00

Brief Description of Requirement:
The Government Office for Science, part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the Authority) is developing a classification system for emerging technology in order to: 
a.	facilitate better understanding of the relationships and linkages between technologies 
b.	reduce confusing conversations around semantics when discussing technologies - aiding joined up work on tech across Government 
c.	provide an indexing structure for our library of reports and other Emerging Technology (EmTech) products. 
Mission Statement: 
The mission is to develop a light-touch and flexible system of categorising technologies, and the relationships between them, to facilitate the sharing of insights across Government.  This taxonomy needs to: 
•	include definitions and search terms for 150 - 200 priority technologies that are currently of interest to x-HMG stakeholders. The Authority will provide a provisional list of technologies and definitions, and would welcome suggestions of additional candidate technologies for inclusion by the provider. 
•	be 'application agnostic'. The Authority considers technologies through multiple policy lenses. Exclusion of information on specific applications of when defining technologies will mean outputs are relevant to a wide range of policy teams, and will mitigate bias towards any specific technology applications or departmental interests. 
•	comprise a schema that flexibly accommodates a broad array of cross-government technology interests.

In 2015/16 the organisation led a 12-month process to develop three Lancashire-wide partnerships to provide specialist employability and skills support to disadvantaged people.   Our partnerships consists of approximately 30 diverse delivery partners from the voluntary, community, and social enterprise sectors, coming together to deliver specialist support for key groups across Lancashire. Selnet is the lead partner and does not undertake any delivery or direct support to participants.

Building Better Opportunities (BBO) is a national programme funded by The National Lottery Community Fund (NLCF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) to invest in local projects tackling the root causes of poverty, promoting social inclusion and driving local jobs and growth. Selnet is Lead Partner on three Building Better Opportunities projects; Age of Opportunity and Invest in Youth have been operational since 1st August 2016 and Changing Futures since 1st February 2017. BBO Lancashire projects have recently received additional investment extending the project to 2023.  

Over the lifetime of the project, over 5600 disadvantaged people will benefit from support tailored to their individual needs and interests to overcome complex barriers and move towards work and training.

Applications are invited from suitably qualified and experienced organisations to provide specialist wellbeing support. In early delivery of our projects it became evident that a significant proportion of BBO participants were experiencing mild to moderate mental health conditions, some diagnosed and some not. These mental health concerns can act as a barrier to progression of the individual into work or education. To this end, we procured the services of an Emotional Wellbeing provider in 2018 and again in 2019, and the same provider has been supporting BBO participants since. In light of extension of all three BBO projects to 2023, we would like to continue to offer a form of emotional wellbeing support to our participants.

Proposals are sought from organisations that can help increase the scope and variety of services that our projects can offer to participants, helping to build confidence and personal skills needed to move towards positive outcomes.  Our delivery teams have highlighted the need for a responsive service to help manage low level mental health concerns in participants whilst they engage with one of our projects.  It is anticipated that people with severe or chronic mental health conditions will need to be referred to existing specialist health services outside of these projects.

The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) is an appointed market surveillance authority, responsible for (via the Secretary of State) enforcing the General Product Safety Regulations (GPSR) within the UK.  

Suppliers are strongly encouraged to read the text at the following link in order to gain a full understanding of the enforcement services role within OPSS: 

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-regulation-enforcement-services  

OPSS is embarking on a testing programme to help it develop a methodology to establish the baseline non-compliance levels of the products it regulates. This project looks to address this evidence gap by conducting full compliance testing on a range of products purchased both online and 'offline'. This tender relates to the 'offline' section of the project and the successful bidder will need to identify popular models, procure, and then arrange delivery for a large number of products to a prearranged testing facility. 
The 15 product types form the 'OPSS Basket of Goods' and takes inspiration from the ONS Consumer Price Index methodology. This is an important project to OPSS, and the testing results generated from products purchased in 'bricks and mortar' retailers will form a major part of the final analysis. If the project is successful, OPSS could look to examine the possibility of running the project over multiple years to help track the impact of its regulatory interventions over time.

1.	Enables housing developments to achieve nutrient neutrality quickly and cost effectively by delivering a pipeline of costed, off site, mitigation projects with known mitigation value, thereby:
a.	unblocking stalled housing (whilst avoiding harm to the protected sites)
b.	facilitating future housing development, including that already in the pipeline
c.	protecting and creating jobs linked to the above
2.	Ensures no adverse impact on the current status of marine Natura 2000 sites protected under the Water Regulations 2017 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.
3.	Simultaneously delivers wider benefits for the environment and society, in line with the Government's environmental objectives (e.g., natural flood risk management, climate change mitigation, biodiversity gains, nature recovery networks, increased access to nature) 
4.	Includes ongoing monitoring and evaluation, helping developers demonstrate the environmental benefits of their schemes and local authorities demonstrate the environmental benefits of growth
5.	Is scalable and replicable in other parts of England (and potentially also places beyond) facing similar spatially specific challenges relating to water or air pollution impacts on internationally important protected sites.
The intention is that developers will pay to offset any new nitrate input into the Solent - from sewage discharge from new housing and other development - by trading credits with farmers, who will in turn offer up land for long term habitat and woodland creation for a period of 80 to 120 years, thereby offsetting against nutrient losses from agricultural diffuse pollution.

Land which is deemed suitable for trade will have been identified through the use of the Land Use Choices Tool (LUCT) supplemented by a range of further data to be provided by the Trading platform operators, including detailed farm records and land record checks, for example. The LUCT will support effective targeting and evaluation of the proposed project sites and add confidence in the long-term viability of proposed sites - taking into account detailed surface water and ground water movement mapping throughout the catchment, constraints to long-term site choices and also climate change proofing. The LUCT may also be used to support prioritisation of trading sites, for example those offering greater overall environmental benefit or higher nutrient mitigation efficiency, particularly for locations which offer potential nitrogen sinks through woodland and wetland development. The LUCT is also likely to inform land eligibility considerations for land owners wishing to enter the trading scheme, for example based on the efficiency of the nutrient pollution reduction that the land can deliver and may also be used to define land ""exclusion zones"" where potential applicants may be refused.",,"BS1 5AH","Any region","73110000 ","Defra/Environment Agency",DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"Nobel House, 17 Smith Square",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,http://defra.bravosolutions.co.uk,"ECM 64002 -ADAS - R&D EA Solent Mapping and Modelling LUCT_Redacted.pdf ",,,03/02/2022,31/12/2022,01/02/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,248980,,03/02/2022,248980,"[RSK ADAS|The Old School,  Stillhouse Lane,  Bristol  BS3 4EB|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,03/02/2022,31/12/2022,"SingleTenderActionNonOJEU ",,12:00

In materials containing hydrogen, present tritium atoms will exchange with hydrogen atoms to form tritiated molecules of the material. This property of tritium is used for trapping tritium in water from the gas passing through the water. However, trapping of gaseous tritium (HT/T2) in such way is more difficult than tritiated water molecules. Therefore, oxidation of the sampled air has to take place during the sampling stage, so it is ensured that all tritium is sampled.
The main exposure route to tritium is via inhalation. If tritium in gaseous form (HT, DT, T2) is inhaled, only small fraction of it is not exhaled, but dissolved in the blood stream and then exhaled after a few minutes. Tritium in form of water (HTO, DTO, T2O) is adsorbed through the skin and in the lungs from inhaled gases. Tritiated water is retained in the body for ~10 days which is its biological half-life. Therefore, exposure to tritiated water in air is up to 25000 times more hazardous than exposure to gaseous tritium.

We are looking for partnerships of young people (age 12-25) working in close collaboration with Kent Creative Partner(s) to plan, curate, commission, promote, and deliver festival activities between May and August 2022 that will celebrate and reconnect young people aged 0 to 25 across the county.
The activities must be an opportunity for young people to develop and lead their own creative ideas. Existing organisations will support the young people by helping them to grow their knowledge of the creative and technical skills of producing and staging events. 
Eight commissions will be delivered within the existing Kent festivals infrastructure, as part of KCC's Reconnect programme, and each organisation may bid for one commission. The voice of young people must be at the very core of each commission for Reconnect Presents. With support from the creative partner, they will drive the development of each activity, drawing on their own insights about the experiences that young people have missed the most throughout the pandemic. Reconnect Presents will reflect the Articles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly Article 31: Every child has the right to relax, play and take part in a wide range of cultural and artistic activities.
The eight activities will be overseen by a project manager and there will be mentors experienced in this kind of work which will support both the young people and host organisations to collaborate successfully to ensure learning outcomes are achieved.
Potential activity might include a 'Reconnect Presents' branded stage programmed by young people at an already established festival. Artform may be influenced by the host festival, but otherwise may include (but not be limited to) music, spoken word, comedy, dance, and physical theatre. Innovative use of digital technology is actively encouraged. Reconnect Presents will seek to achieve a wide geographic spread of activities to ensure that young people can easily access the offer.
Reconnect Presents will empower young people across Kent to realise their creative potential. It will engage and inspire, providing a range of opportunities for young people including as producers, artists, participants, promoters, and audiences. The young people leading each commission will have access to a panel of experienced mentors, which is being commissioned separately, to inspire, support and guide them through the process. The successful creative partner organisations will be able to demonstrate their ability to work with young people who will be supported by their mentors.",,,"South East","79952000 ","Sam Wright",sam.wright@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,14/02/2022,31/08/2022,26/01/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,96411,96411,03/02/2022,96411,"[Canterbury Festival|Festival House

This procurement is being concluded following a mini competition under the CCS RM6018 Research Marketplace DPS.

This project will provide the first detailed look at adoption and diffusion in the UK economy. There is a lot we do not know about adoption and diffusion in the UK. What we know is that diffusion has slowed, with the gap between those companies operating at the technological frontier and those operating inside this frontier having widened. To fix the UK diffusion engine, we must first understand it. 

This project is split into two sections. We expect all bidders to explain how they would answer the questions and sub-questions listed in section one. For section two, bidders should focus on where they can add most value.

This guidance will need to be updated, as plants below 300MW and new plant types (e.g. combined heat and power, energy from waste and biomass) may now be assessed for carbon capture readiness. It will also need to be expanded to cover hydrogen readiness.

The Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)  are therefore commissioning two technical studies. One on Lot 1 - Hydrogen readiness and one on Lot 2 - Carbon capture readiness. 

Suppliers may bid for both lots if they wish to. Bidders may bid for (and be awarded into) one or both lots on this contract.

Maximum Value of the Opportunity:
£80,000.00 (Maximum) Excluding VAT

£40,000 excluding VAT for Lot 1 
£40,000 excluding VAT for Lot 2

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the ITQ  document.

c.	What information and communications are needed to notify customers of digital services to make the transition experience as positive as possible?
d.	What are customers attitudes towards an online ChB service?
e.	How much acceptance/resistance is likely for the potential to move to a 'digital by default' service?
f.	What customers would like to use a ChB digital service? What will the demographic of a digital ChB customer base be? 
g.	What do customers expect from a ChB digital service?

CN/1221,Contract,"The Committee On Climate Change",Awarded,2022-02-15T10:57:30Z,"Net Zero power and hydrogen: capacity requirements for flexibility","The Climate Change Act sets legally-binding targets for the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. It includes a 2050 target for Net Zero emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, and a series of five-yearly carbon budgets towards that 2050 target. 

In 2020 the CCC advised the Government that the Sixth Carbon Budget, covering the period 2033-37, should be set at 78% below 1990 levels.  And  that the UK's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UN global process should be a 68% reduction in greenhouse aas emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. 

The Government have accepted both these recommendations, and legislated the Sixth Carbon Budget in June 2021.

Underpinning the CCC's advice on the Sixth Budget and the NDC was a set of scenarios for emissions from electricity generation to 2050.  These informed a recommendation to Government, as part of the advice, that use of unabated gas for electricity generation should be phased out by 2035 - meaning all electricity generation would be low-carbon from that date. In its Net Zero Strategy the Government have now adopted that target. 

A core duty of the CCC under the Climate Change Act is to publish an annual report for Parliament monitoring progress towards meeting carbon budgets. 

The CCC has previously developed a set of tracking indicators to monitor progress on an annual basis. For the 2022 Progress Report the CCC will be refreshing these indicators, in light of the new Net Zero and Sixth Carbon Budget targets.

As part of this process the CCC would like to produce new indicators focusing on the capacity deployment pathway for schedulable low-carbon generation and for other sources of flexibility, including interactions with the production of hydrogen.

The work includes the installation of new path surfaces, metal-edged planting beds, fencing, gates, brick-paved areas, an open-sided green roof structure, irrigation points, structures for climbing plants and a fruit cage. The new garden is located on the site of the current kitchen garden at RBG Kew and will open to visitors in early spring 2022.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew is a world-famous centre for botanical and mycological knowledge. With our two inspiring gardens at Kew Gardens in west London and Wakehurst in Sussex, we enchant our visitors with the wonder of plant diversity and botanical science.

At Kew Gardens, the kitchen garden was created for the television series 'Kew on a Plate' in 2015. Since then, the garden has grown in popularity and become a key visitor attraction, offering seasonal vegetables and choice cultivars on display throughout the year. Currently, the Kitchen Garden is open to visitors and school groups, holding focused events including weekly horticulture and science tours and produce sales. The location of the garden is in the northeast corner of Kew:
 
The current site is not fit for purpose, as grass paths are inaccessible for wheelbarrows, wheelchair users and prams in wet weather. There is also no gathering space or shelter from the rain for group tours and demonstrations. An open boundary and lack of suitable netting provides little protection from pests. See drawing RBGK-11566-100-102 Existing Landscape Plan.

The proposal is to convert the grass turf paths to porous, self-binding gravel, installed mostly without excavation, using a cellular confinement system. This surface is a loose material that compacts with use but retains porosity and was successfully used with metal edging in the recently renovated Agius Evolution Garden. The planting areas will be raised up slightly using metal edges and will promote the current approach of no dig cultivation.

Designated entrance areas and a gathering/education space will be paved with clay brick pavers to provide a hard-wearing surface; in-keeping with the existing brick walls and brick edging along the Rose Pergola walkway. 

You are hereby invited to submit a tender to meet the Customer's requirements in accordance with the specification and associated documents as contained within the tender pack.

This work will give us a better understanding of the supply chain cyber security measures taken globally. The intermediate and final outputs will be used to inform our nascent partnership building initiatives and ensure that we can support the development of any energy, chemicals and space sector cyber security supply chain policy, and feed in our views for any cross-government supply chain approaches in the UK context.

Throughout the project the following objectives should be addressed and evidenced:
• To understand how governments internationally are enabling or supporting organisations to develop their cyber resilience by addressing cyber security supply chain risks across the energy (including operational technology), chemicals and space sectors.
• To learn what is considered best policy practice (voluntary and regulatory) in either energy (including operational technology), chemicals and space supply chain practice, and identify possible policy options for us.
• Learn what is considered best policy practice (voluntary and regulatory) in cyber security supply chain practice, where it is transferrable to the energy sector (including operational technology), chemicals and space sector.
• Identify cyber security supply chain partnership delivery models and identify their success factors and barriers.
• To inform and improve the delivery of our proposed cyber security supply chain code of practice and partnership.

The project stages shall be detailed in the subsequent Invitation to Tender (ITT) however broadly open-source research will be used to develop a comprehensive understanding of global cyber security supply chain measures in the energy, operational technology, chemicals and space sectors as well as exploring codes of practice / partnership within these sectors. The data gathered will then be analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods to produce the required outputs. The outputs will include a project report and recommendations, accompanying summary presentation, presentation for stakeholders, case studies on codes of practice / partnership and a database.

We want to continue to offer a short breaks programme with greater flexibility with regard to when the short break is taken and the length of the short break.

short breaks.

We are seeking providers who can deliver the below range of short break activities. 

This list is not exhaustive, and we welcome additional ideas for short breaks from providers themselves that meet the general aims of the Short Beaks Programme.

a) Sports activities scheme including horse riding, swimming lessons, sports clubs etc
b) Holiday play schemes
c) Music activities (including therapy)
d) Activities that develop independence such as cookery sessions, friendship groups, clubs
e) Family cinema screenings and theatre performances
f) Creative activities including young reporters scheme
g) After-school clubs
h) Homecare/community support to work directly with the Children with Disabilities Social Work team.

Short breaks to be commissioned (not currently provided)
i) Overnights - e.g. activity breaks, museums, sleep-overs, camping (outside of residential care).
j) After school clubs

The workshops will be held either face to face or online and will be attended by approximately 24 patients and healthcare professionals.  
      The objective of the workshops is to co-produce the content of a digital self-management (D-MAPP) intervention for people with distal upper limb musculoskeletal disorders (DUL-MSDs).
      We will recruit the attendees for these workshops and produce materials to support discussion and the co-production. 
      We require a facilitator(s) to help us plan the workshops to best meet our objective (for example, what methods to use to encourage open discussion and practical expertise on the most suitable schedule for the workshops). We also require a facilitator to chair the workshops, ensuring all attendees can contribute and that the workshops keep to time. At each workshop, a minimum of two researchers from the project will also attend to help run the workshops and provide the technical expertise on the condition. 
      About the project: 
      We have been awarded a six-year applied research programme grant from the NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) to co-designing a digital health intervention, Digital-My Arm Pain Programme (D-MAPP), to reduce pain and improve long-term function for people with distal upper limb musculoskeletal disorders (DUL-MSDs). DUL-MSDs are painful elbow, forearm, wrist and hand conditions, including hand and thumb osteoarthritis (OA), tennis elbow, tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
      We anticipate that the D-MAPP website will comprise a range of guided exercises and tailored self-management information specific to individual conditions, with features for goal setting and monitoring. Co-design is at the heart of the D-MAPP project. Therefore, we will be developing the content and features of the D-MAPP website collaboratively with patients and healthcare professionals. By 'co-design', we refer to a process of design that actively involves key stakeholders and supports them in creating a solution in line with their needs and experiences.",,,"Yorkshire and The Humber","79000000 ","Ben Waters",a.b.waters@leeds.ac.uk,"Purchasing Office","1 - 3 Lifton Villas",Leeds,"LS2 9JZ",UK,'+441133434104,,,"https://www.delta-esourcing.com/delta/respondToList.html?noticeId=663588634 ",,01/06/2022,05/09/2022,01/02/2022,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,20300,,01/02/2022,20300,"[Realise (Europe) Limited|30-34 North Street

OREC001-DN573419-69445422,Contract,"Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult",Awarded,2022-02-02T10:01:53Z,"Floating Offshore Wind - Project Finance (Lot 1) and Insurance (Lot 2)","This project investigates two separate but connected themes that affect the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of FOW projects: bankability and insurability. Both are impacted by perceived risk, but impact project costs in different ways.

The first large scale (>500MW) UK FOW projects are expected to use long-term debt to finance a substantial proportion of the project. This is one of the drivers of the anticipated rapid cost reduction in FOW LCOE at the end of the 2020s and early 2030s. However, to enable this low cost of capital we need to ensure the finance community understand FOW projects, technologies, risks and opportunities.
This project is aimed at understanding the current views and proposed approach of the finance community to investing in FOW projects, what the industry can do to address any concerns, and raise the profile of the investment opportunities in FOW.

At the same time, insurance premiums for offshore wind farms have been rising sharply in recent years driven by a range of factors. One of the key factors is an increase in claims in certain areas, and hence increased risk / exposure of insurance companies to such claims. All of these areas are directly relevant to FOW, and in some areas the risk profile in FOW may be perceived to be even higher - for example, cable technology. In addition, FOW projects include a number of novel components which shall be critical to performance and integrity of the project - for example, mooring and anchoring systems. In these areas there is a lack of information regarding technology reliability and risk in the context of their application to FOW. This project is aimed at understanding the current views and proposed approach of the insurance community to insuring FOW projects, what the industry can do to address any concerns, and what opportunities there might be for alternative / more appropriate insurance structures to be used within the industry to provide adequate insurance most cost effectively.

The pilot provided businesses with the opportunity to chat informally to an experienced volunteer about whatever was making them feel stressed in relation to how COVID 19 impacted on them.  \r
\r
 The service was initially designed around feedback from Business Advisors who had experienced some challenging conversations with business owners and from business leaders who were seeking support as a result of COVID 19. In many instances the business owners vented their concerns at the Business Advisor; these conversations were emotive and expressed how the business owner was feeling, at the height of the restrictions.  \r
\r
 The pilot operated from December 2020 until March 2021.  Due to low initial take-up of the one-to-one service the project expanded its offer to ensure reach by hosting two webinar-style events. Additional marketing was also undertaken to promote these events and encourage take-up. The workshop events proved to be popular, and the pilot was able to meet output targets.  \r
\r
 The second phase of the Listening Ear will not only support businesses but will expand its reach to provide support to individuals who are currently in employment, seeking employment or are entering into the job market.  \r
