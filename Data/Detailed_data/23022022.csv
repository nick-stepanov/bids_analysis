      The BCP business case and transformation plan is delivering a new system of early help for children and families based in 10 localities.  It is developing a culture of early help being everyone's responsibility, building capacity through new family support professionals, in the community, with schools and nurseries and through digital support.  We are supporting vulnerable families to access this new capacity and to be more resilient in achieving their own outcomes.
      
      The early help plans for the city were accelerated during the Covid emergency and have now supported over 17,000 families with a short-term resilience grant, wider family support, and community grants to 162 local organisations.  Over the current year the aim is to build capacity further and to develop multi-disciplinary teams in each locality including strong links to the provider of this contract.
      
      The contract will last for a maximum contract duration of 3 years (unless terminated under the terms and conditions of the contract). The contract will be on rolling yearly basis.

This commitment became enshrined within our Environmental Sustainability Strategy, which was agreed by the Council's Executive in the summer of 2020. This Strategy commits us to achieving net zero carbon for our own operations by 2030, as well as tackling a range of other environmental issues both within the council and across the borough.
We are in the process of gathering data and calculating our carbon footprints for scope 1 & 2 for the financial years 2019/20 and 2020/21. We have chosen 2019/20 as our baseline year as: a) it provides a 10-year trajectory to 2030; b) it aligns with Surrey County Council's baseline, and that of other boroughs and districts within Surrey, and c) it provides a more representative, pre-Covid19 scenario. We will be using the Local Partnerships GHG Accounting Tool for the calculations. 
We are looking for support to verify our carbon footprint calcuations, to support us develop a programme to implement transition of operational buildings to zero carbon as far as possible; and to provide advice in respect of our approach to monitoring and meausing scope 3 emissions",,,"South East","90700000 ","Sourcing Solutions Team",OrbisSourcingSolutions@eastsussex.gov.uk,"Town Hall,Castlefield Road",,REIGATE,RH20SH,England,,,,,,14/03/2022,13/03/2023,01/02/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,23950,,23/02/2022,23950,"[OPTOPIA LTD|4 Dukes Court Bognor Road

Our use of this system is primarily for bio-medical research (and some plant specimen work) to perform high-resolution and high-speed imaging on biological material. The ImageBio266 instrument from ESI that we selected is optimized to ablate soft biological tissue mounted on a range of glass substrates.

Several pieces of work have been carried out over the last few years to test and develop effective approaches to comms messaging (See: 2014 Messaging Report, 2020 risk communication toolkit and supporting research)
Earlier this year, Social Science published the paper 'Qualitative consumer research to explore communications on food safety messaging (2021)'. This work aimed to enhance the FSA's understanding of current behavioural drivers and attitudes towards communicating food safety messages and how these may vary by audiences.
Four over-arching communication approaches were tested via 30 two-hour long video-enabled focus group and 20 one-hour long telephone depth interviews.
Participants from the general population were stratified by age and life-stage across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Participants from Chinese, Black African, Black Caribbean, Pakistani and Indian minority communities were specifically represented to explore cultural differences in message reception.
Participants were shown and asked to respond to up to six pieces of stimulus materials - short food safety messages accompanied by stock images, designed to test theoretical approaches to communicating food safety.
Qualitative findings were analysed using the COM-B framework and used to develop a Food Safety Communications Toolkit which provides a framework for communicating food safety to consumers.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,FSA.Procurement@food.gov.uk,"Foss House, Peasholme Green",,York,"YO1 7PR",England,,,"WP27 - Call Off Agreement Form Signed_Redacted.pdf ",,,08/02/2022,30/04/2022,28/11/2019,YES,tender_217564/807610,Yes,Yes,No,Services,99350,,18/02/2022,99350,"[Ipos Mori|3 Thomas More Square, London, Greater London, E1W 1YW, UNITED KINGDOM|NONE_OTHER||Yes|Yes]",,08/02/2022,30/04/2022,"Other Calling off from an existing call off contract",,12:00

      Examples of engagement between heritage (and other bodies) exist at both local and regional level. An example HE has engaged with, and supported, for several years has been though Regional Historic Environment Forums (HEFs).  Regional HEFs have been in existence since the early 2000's, but, in many instances, their activity levels and presence has diminished .  
      A review of regional HEFs undertaken during 2019/20  concluded that whilst many HEFs were not as active as they once were, there is still very much a need and appetite for some form of local historic environment network and for mechanisms that can help heritage organisations working at local or regional level to meet, share and develop ideas, and engage effectively with national heritage organisations. 
      
      It is anticipated there will be two phases to this piece of work.  HE is seeking to commission the first phase (this project) and will focus on understanding the need and purpose for a regional network/forum(s), current engagement levels and activities across the region, including a mapping exercise, the aspirations of local groups and organisations (including HE's own role in any forum/network) and examples of sustainable governance models. This project is focused on the HE Midlands area.
      Based on recommendations and lessons learned from the successful completion of Phase One, a secondary phase may follow that will trial the (re-)establishment of a regional network/forum(s) in the HE Midlands area, and to help inform activity in other HE regions as needed.

(Please refer to attachment Appendix 1. Schedule A- Service Specification SEN Mediation.)

It is anticipated within the contract term the Council will receive approximately eighty 80-95 referrals for SEN Mediation per annum.

The contract will commence on 01/04/2022 and will run for a period of 3 years of the initial contract term making the expiry date 31/03/2025. The contract will have an option to extend by 2 x 12 months at the sole discretion of the Council making the latest possible end date 31/03/2027.

The estimated contract value is approximately £175,000. This is based on last financial years expenditure (£35,000) which did increase considerably due to panel decision making. Given that this is a statutory service any spend will be subject to fluctuation and in line with referral demands. These costs are indicative only and do not carry any guarantee of value or volume of business over the contract term. Actual future needs may vary up or down.

The Council is committed to a performance and evidence-based approach to Social Value and has partnered with the Social Value Portal (SVP) to assist in the delivery of this. Based on the National TOMs (Themes, Outcomes and Measures) developed by the SVP, bidders are required to propose credible targets against which performance (for the successful bidder) will be monitored. The National TOMs are available to review at the SVP (http://socialvalueportal.com/national-toms/) and bidders will also be given access to them as part of this tender. The TOMs within this tender process have been adapted to reflect the specific needs of the organisation.

These are to be sent to customers of the kerbside garden waste collection service in North Somerset for the new service year running from March 2022-23, with an optional 12-month extension from March 2023-24.\r
\r
The garden waste service is a chargeable kerbside collection service that runs from April 1st to March 31st every year. Residents are invited to sign up from early March onwards to receive collections for the time-period specified above. They can sign up for a maximum of two permit stickers or two tags per household. After signing up, the resident is sent a garden waste permit in the form of an adhesive sticker for their bin or a polytuff tag to attach to their bags by looping it around one of the handles. The permit serves as an aid to the collection crew in identifying which properties are signed up to the service.\r
\r
In year (1st April 2021 - 31st March 2022) we had about 50,000 sign ups across 43,000 households. This means for the new service year, we require approximately 55,000 permits and tags (52,000 permits, 3,000 tags) to be printed and posted over the March 2022 - March 2023 period. The first mail-out will be the week commencing 14th March.\r
\r
Most of the permits will be issued during the first three months. As a rough estimation based on last year's figures, we are expecting a cumulative total of approximately 22,000 mail-outs (number and type of permits included variable) to be mailed out within the first 4 weeks of sign up going live.\r
\r
We can supply design files for the permits, with artwork as HR PDF with crops and bleeds, if required. If following our design would result in extra cost, please state this in your tender response. Alternatively, if you provide a ready-made cutter, please also let us know.\r
\r
Permits need to be mailed out twice weekly. Data (including but not limited to address details, title, resident surname, permit type etc) will be provided via a secure method twice weekly. The data will indicate the number of registrations at each address (1 sticker, 2 stickers, 1 tag or 2 tags). The permits will need to be posted out with a mail-merged covering letter showing the residents name and address (folded and hand inserted), using the data provided.

The project will raise awareness of the latest technology and will be retro-fittable to legacy manufacturing facilities. The technology will be able to provide a tangible benefit to the carbon footprint of a manufacturing site through data capture and visualisation and / or machine cognition.  
Please note that two tenders associated with this project will be running concurrently.  These are 3125/SW and 3126/SW.  The two tenders have differing cost/quality weightings.   It is the University's intention to award all lots associated with both tenders, however we reserve the right not to award any lot or all lots.  

Scope of Requirement:
The equipment / system is required to demonstrate how IIoT can be used in a manufacturing environment to understand, influence, and change the key levers in carbon reduction. A range of technologies will be implemented to understand energy usage, occupancy and asset parameters, environmental conditions, utilisation of micro grid technology and visualisation through a user-friendly dashboard. The system will need to be supported or controllable to evolve and integrate system adaptations and enlargement, to support the project goals of demonstrating the potential benefits.  The AMRC/University requires a warranty, delivery to site and on-site installation, commissioning, and acceptance testing. The supplier needs to be able to maintain and demonstrate the ability to maintain the future operation of the system. The AMRC/University requires a service and maintenance contract for the duration of the manufacturer's warranty and to not invalidate the manufacturer's terms and conditions of warranty. Training and technical support is required within the scope of the tender to assist and embed the use of the equipment/system. 
The full technical specification can be found in the tender documentation which will be sent to you once you have expressed your interest.

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.

Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.

As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament.

The project will raise awareness of the latest technology and will be retro-fittable to legacy manufacturing facilities. The technology will be able to provide a tangible benefit to the carbon footprint of a manufacturing site through data capture and visualisation and / or machine cognition.  
Please note that two tenders associated with this project will be running concurrently.  These are 3125/SW and 3126/SW.  The two tenders have differing cost/quality weightings.   It is the University's intention to award all lots associated with both tenders, however we reserve the right not to award any lot or all lots.  

Scope of Requirement:
The equipment / system is required to demonstrate how IIoT can be used in a manufacturing environment to understand, influence, and change the key levers in carbon reduction. A range of technologies will be implemented to understand energy usage, occupancy and asset parameters, environmental conditions, utilisation of micro grid technology and visualisation through a user-friendly dashboard. The system will need to be supported or controllable to evolve and integrate system adaptations and enlargement, to support the project goals of demonstrating the potential benefits.  The AMRC/University requires a warranty, delivery to site and on-site installation, commissioning, and acceptance testing. The supplier needs to be able to maintain and demonstrate the ability to maintain the future operation of the system. The AMRC/University requires a service and maintenance contract for the duration of the manufacturer's warranty and to not invalidate the manufacturer's terms and conditions of warranty. Training and technical support is required within the scope of the tender to assist and embed the use of the equipment/system. 
The full technical specification can be found in the tender documentation which will be sent to you once you have expressed your interest. 

Tender Process and Documentation:

This is an E.U. open exercise. The ITT can be downloaded by registering and expressing your interest on the University`s e-tendering system https://in-tendhost.co.uk/Sheffield.

If you have any questions or comments in relation to this tender they must be submitted via the In-tend System, this can be accessed at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/Sheffield

"IT-100-3568-QU549 - AWARD",Contract,"Birmingham City Council",Awarded,2022-03-02T00:33:40Z,"QU549 - Development of Eating Guides that Celebrate Culture  - AWARD","The Eatwell Guide is the UK national guideline on how to eat a healthy balanced diet. The Eatwell Guide divides the foods we eat and drink into 5 main food groups: fruit and veg, starchy foods, dairy or dairy alternatives, proteins, and unsaturated fats. On average, women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules) and men should have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). However, the Eatwell Guide is made with European diets in mind and is not fit for purpose for other cultural diets. 
      
      In line with BCC's desire to celebrate culture in Birmingham and as part of the Commonwealth Games 2022 legacy, we are commissioning a project to develop eating guides for different cultural diets. These eating guides will aim to celebrate culture and foster healthier eating habits. This is an exciting piece of work that will place Birmingham at the forefront of creating resources to foster healthy eating for people of all cultures. 
      
      The objectives of this project are to:

Engagement of the social care providers sector is strategically important for ICSs. It will be particularly important for Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) to harness the innovation and creativity within the care provider sector.
The overall aim of this piece of work is to contribute to the effectiveness of ICSs in bringing partners together to tackle health and care system challenges and improve outcomes for people and communities. Within this, our objectives are to:
• understand enablers, barriers and potential models/approaches that can support effective partnership between ICSs and the care providers sector
• build on existing processes for engagement of this sector at local authority footprint and at whole system footprint
• inform a national development programme
• support NHS England to listen and respond to concerns relating to ICS collaboration.
To deliver these objectives we expect the following deliverables:
• rapid review of existing insights into the challenges and opportunities, for example feedback submitted from the sector in relation to ICS legislative proposals and the ICP engagement document
• up to 15 interviews with key individuals from the sector, from the NHS, and from care sector national and regional/county bodies and associations

SFAA221121,Contract,"Greater Birmingham & Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership",Awarded,2022-02-23T10:43:29Z,"Creative Industries Low Carbon Consultancy","The Creative Industries sector will need to achieve full decarbonisation by 2041 to align with the region's 2041 Net Zero carbon target laid out in #WM2041. There are a number of challenges to decarbonize certain elements of the sector, including transport, buildings, festivals/events and supply chains. However, the adoption of low carbon approaches in the sector can also be an enabler of growth by offering businesses an opportunity to pivot their business models to align with an area of significant growth, to tap into new branding opportunities, and to participate in regional innovation.

The West Midlands has natural sector strengths in both the Creative Industries sector, and the Low Carbon sector, and through collaboration and co-ordination there is an opportunity for the region to demonstrate its leadership in these areas and the synergies between them. Both nationally and regionally, there are a number of examples of businesses and projects within the Creative Industries sector that have adopted or encourage the adoption of low carbon approaches. However, to-date the state of the sector's adoption of Low Carbon is poorly defined.

The Greater Birmingham & Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership (GBSLEP) requires a supplier to provide a research study into the adoption of low carbon approaches within the West Midlands' Creative Industries. The research will support GBSLEP and other policymakers in defining the current state of the sector's progress with respect to Net Zero and inform the development of an implementation plan for the region's Creative Industries.

This includes advising on and assessment of referrals to the second component of the service, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), programme.
The IAPT programme is a long standing nationally mandated programme for the treatment of adult anxiety disorders and depression. The national expectation as set out in the NHS Long Term Plan is that the number of people with anxiety disorders or depression who can access talking therapies through IAPT increase by an additional 380,000 per year to reach 1.9 million by 2023/24. IAPT services are characterised by three things, evidenced-based psychological therapies, routine outcome monitoring and regular outcomes focused supervision of staff providing the service.

With being a trusted source of information, we had to move from people mainly contacting us via phone, to an online web chat function and self help through a daily updated Covid Landing page. Whist the support we offered worked and businesses in the borough found it very useful, it became clear that due to the age of the website and issues with the original company who built it going out of business, it is no longer fit for purpose. In addition, we have the ambition to make sure any business in Barnsley can access some form of business support. Due to the cost of integration of the current model, this needs to build on the self service model we used during Covid 19. An LMS as well as making sure it is easy for companies to find information that is relevant to them quickly and effectively is key to this. 

It has been decided that a full rebuild of the current Enterprising Barnsley and DMC's websites is the best approach to achieve the outcomes we are wanting. Whilst doing this, it makes sense to refresh the visual brand of the Enterprising Barnsley service to bring it in line with the work done for the branding of the DMC's & the Seam. The work also needs to integrate a grant application portal which will allow businesses a smoother easier and clearer way of applying for a range of business support grants than the current process. This will also allow BMBC staff to be more efficient in the management of these grants, ultimately increasing productivity and reducing time for the support to reach the businesses. 

We are wanting a single log in to the website where businesses can log in and see all different grants they have applied for as well as the any learning they have undertaken on the LMS. This single log in will allow us to add in extra functionality in the future if more funding is secured to help improve the service we deliver even further. With this in mind, we would welcome the organisations bidding for the work to propose a road map of what additional features they feel could be integrated into the websites going forwards.

      Horsham Skate Park was designed and built in 2001 with a strong input from the local skate and BMX community. The Skate Park saw users travel from all across the County to use its large wooden playground with a variety of features to suit the needs of all the disciplines.  Well attended 'Jams' were celebrated and remembered fondly, attracting large crowds from all across the south east over the Skate Park's initial 10 years. The Skate Park's current location, in the busy Horsham Park, has seen multiple design layouts over the past 19 years. Today's design features many large transitions and hips which support a thriving BMX and Scooter scene - and still attracts pro and sponsored riders from these disciplines. Whilst there is still attendance from local skateboarders, the riding surface of the flat areas has become uneven and rough and other local concrete options provide a better offer. 
      
      Horsham Park is the town's largest park and site for the swimming pool and leisure centre. The Skate Park is therefore used by a large cross section of age groups including toddlers and young children. As well as being situated amongst a busy Park, the Skate Park is five minutes walk from Collyer's, the town's Sixth Form College. This means the Skate Park is well populated by students throughout weekdays to 'hang out' as well as ride.
      
      The existing Skate Park is 1000m2 constructed in plywood on a tarmac surface.
      
      The outcome of this Tender is to identify and select a single Contractor to take the Project forward to a final design, including user consultation and a completed installed concrete Skate Park, to suit the needs of the local young people whilst taking into account a range of ages, abilities and wheels whilst taking into account the site constraints.",,"RH12 1RL","South East","45212100 ","Horsham District Council",procurement@horsham.gov.uk,"North Street",Horsham,"West Sussex","RH12 1RL","United Kingdom","01403 215100",,,,,08/02/2022,23/12/2022,03/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,250000,250000,18/02/2022,250000,"[Betongpark Limited|Studio P, Hackney Depot , 5 Sheep Lane, London, Greater London, United Kingdom, E8 4QY|NONE||No|No]",,08/02/2022,23/12/2022,"Open ",,12:00
