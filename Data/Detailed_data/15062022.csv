The first part is a review of the Council's adopted Community Infrastructure Schedule Charging Schedule which commenced operation on 1st August 2016. This is to ensure it is up to date, reflects market conditions, takes account of new national and local requirements and evidence since adoption and does not render development unviable while maximising the potential community benefits resulting from growth in the Borough. The BNP Paribas CIL Viability Study (2014) is the evidence base for the Council's adopted CIL Charging Schedule.

Alongside this the second part of the work will be linked to the review of the Local Plan and the draft local plan requirements, in terms of whole plan viability, and the viability of any future site allocations.

It is anticipated that the chosen consultant will support the Council through representation at a CIL Examination and/or Local Plan Examination and this should be reflected in the costs of providing a service.

The is 32 ha in total covering land on the two adjacent farms. 
The project involves creation of an access track (quad bike access, involving no materials brought to site), ground preparation (incl. bracken control), fence removal, new fencing and tree planting, according to a detailed specification.  
In total, 33630 trees and shrubs will be planted and protected. The density of the planting will vary with areas of shrubs and open ground. The lower section of the site will be planted at 1600 stems per ha, whilst the higher area will be planted at 1100 stems per ha. The area will not be made rabbit proof so the trees will be individually protected.  The area to be planted will primarily be dictated by the ground conditions and the existing tree cover on the site. A maximum of 20% of the area will be left as open space. The open space will be around footpaths, archaeological features, existing priority habitats and rocky areas where the soil is very shallow.
The scheme has been through the EIA determination process and any other consents will be in place prior to works starting. 
Payments will be made and contracts entered into with the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority.

The contract award would include a commercial license to publish online digital images and associated metadata, and a requirement to undertake all the necessary activities to make that possible - including conservation, digital image capture, use of metadata to allow for meaningful searches of the records, and online publication. TNA expects that the appointed Supplier will deliver the contract at NIL cost to TNA, and will also deliver a royalty return to TNA during the contract period, in consideration for the licence to publish the Collection. 

Environmental History is the study of how humans have interacted with the environment in the past. It encompasses the role of nature through human history in a broad social, political, economic and cultural analysis. This collection of up to 2,367 documents will be an important resource enabling the study of colonial and post-colonial environments in the twentieth century, from 1899 up to the 1990s. The early material addresses popular themes such as imperial forestry, wildlife conservation and national parks, soil conservation, tropical disease research, colonial land tenure, industrial development and agriculture. Later material is drawn from the Overseas Development departments and focuses on development aid in the context of natural resources, energy, population and public health, urbanization, pollution, warfare, human responses to natural disasters, renewable technology and climate.

The service provision will be divided into 2 lots - one for Aylesbury and one for High Wycombe. Organisations can tender for one or both lots.

LOT 1 - Aylesbury
The scheme for Aylesbury focuses on improving connectivity to the rural areas surrounding Aylesbury (Weedon, Hartwell, Aston Clinton, Weston Turville and Halton) which are currently under-served by traditional bus routes. The DRT service will provide better connections to local economic, retail, education, and healthcare facilities, notably Stoke Mandeville Hospital (SMH) which is an important local employer and a key regional hospital. 

The budget for this service is Â£1,700,000 for the full contract term.

LOT 2 - High Wycombe
The scheme for High Wycombe focuses on improving connectivity to the rural areas surrounding High Wycombe (Booker, Downley, and Wooburn Green). These areas are currently under-served by traditional bus routes so implementing a DRT service will provide better connections to local economic, retail, education and healthcare facilities, notably the Cressex Industrial Park which is a key source of employment in the area, town centre, railway station and hospital.
The budget for this service is Â£2,600,000 for the full contract term.

The contract start date for both services is Wednesday 1st June 2022. The contract term is 3 years with the option to extend for two further 12 month periods.

The purpose of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is to serve the public interest by setting high standards of corporate governance, reporting and audit and by holding to account those responsible for delivering them.
Delivering on our purpose will bring a variety of benefits. Improved outcomes, created by each of our regulatory activities are shown in the circle; each of which can positively reinforce others in the circle and contribute to overall benefits for a wide range of stakeholders such as greater transparency, increased trust in UK markets and a lower cost of capital for companies. Our direct stakeholders include companies, institutional investors, auditors, actuaries, accountants and their respective professional bodies. Our indirect stakeholders include retail shareholders, suppliers, employees, customers, communities, pensioners and savers, and financial institutions, all of whom have an interest in the health of companies and other organisations within our existing and future regulatory scope and in the success of the UK corporate sector as a whole.

The FRC had a requirement for Leadership Training Services. We required a structured programme of leadership development, specifically for newly appointed and emerging leaders (for use when existing public sector provisions do not fully address our requirements).

The aim of the leadership development is for the FRC delegate to develop advanced skills that are needed for them to take on more senior position within FRC.
We expect the programme(s) to be: -
â¢	Established with a track record of successful learning outcomes
â¢	Commitment to cross sector diversity
â¢	Specifically aimed newly appointed and emerging leaders
â¢	Relevant and Focused (on key leadership challenges and skills required)
â¢	Option of residential / online with mixed delegate groups (i.e. not just FRC delegates)

KENT001-DN572658-20146405,Contract,"Kent County Council",Awarded,2022-07-14T10:08:54+01:00,"Herne Relief Road (SC21059)","The aim of the Herne Relief Road is to alleviate existing traffic congestion concerns through the historic village of Herne. The village of Herne is subject to an existing Air Quality Management Area. The scheme aims to provide an alternative route to the existing constrained A291 and therefore reduce congestion and improve journey time reliability through the vicinity of Herne and support the construction of approximately 3,000 homes. The project also addressed the concerns of local residents, in regard to the safety of the current junctions between Bullockstone Road and A291 Canterbury Road and Bullockstone Road and Lower Herne Road. 

The Relief Road takes the form of a widened Bullockstone Road, currently a minor country lane that connects the village of Greenhill and the old Thanet Way with the A291 Canterbury Road. This includes new roundabout junctions to upgrade the existing priority junction between A291 Canterbury Road and Bullockstone Road and the creation of a new junction between the Strode Farm Development Spine Road and Bullockstone Road. Bullockstone Road is to be widened to a 7m carriageway between these two junctions. The works also include the provision of a new pedestrian/cycling facility along the full extent of Bullockstone Road. The Relief Road, in combination with a Spine Road through the Strode Farm Housing development, aims to provide an alternative route for strategic traffic between A299 and Canterbury, avoiding historic Herne village.

The project is funded by developer contributions from three nearby housing developments (Strode Farm, Lower Herne Golf Club and Hillborough). Kent County Council have also secured Â£2.1m from the Growing Places Fund to help forward fund the scheme. 

The extent of the works included within the scope of this contract extend from the junction between the A291 Canterbury Road and Bullockstone Road to the junction between Lower Herne Road and Bullockstone Road. The work extent includes the construction of two highway drainage attenuation ponds, one to the north of Lower Herne Road and one to the west of Bullockstone Road, to the south of Hares Wood. The carriageway widening will impact Bullockstone Hill Wood, which borders the road to the east at the northern extent of the works. Bullockstone Hill Wood has designated Ancient Woodland status. 

KCC are supporting Canterbury City Council and are responsible for the design and delivery of the project. The scheme is split into two phases and thus the anticipated construction period will be circa 70 weeks and the anticipated construction costs are circa Â£5m.

The proposed unit will allow inert charging and sintering of a batch size of a minimum of 50 kg of NdFeB under vacuum or inert atmosphere.

Note, due to space requirements of the system, the proposed sintering system will be installed at Tyesley Energy Park in Birmingham.

This project is funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund; Driving the Electric Revolution.

General characteristics
A sintering furnace for NdFeB with a minimum capacity of 50 kg per batch. The system must incorporate inert loading of pressed NdFeB compacts.
The equipment must comply with all the relevant UK law, regulations, and British Standards.

Specification
i. Requirements
1) The complete system must be capable of the handling of batch sizes of a minimum of 50 kg, nominally for rectangular magnet blocks with dimensions up to 40mm x 40mm x 20mm.
2) The system should allow for inert loading of pressed compacts by use of a glove box system. 
3) The system needs to be ergonomically designed for the efficient handling of the material, facilitating the inert handling and transfer of green compacts (maximum oxygen content 20 ppm) also allowing for the easy transfer in and out of sintering trays.
4) The sintering vessel should be capable of being pumped down to a vacuum level of 10-4 mBar, with appropriate filters / traps to avoid powder entering the vacuum pump.
5) The sintering furnace must be capable of consistently achieving temperatures up to a minimum of 1200Â°C under vacuum or inert gas with good thermal uniformity (in the order of +/-5Â°C) during the ramp and sintering stages.
6) During the sintering process hydrogen will be evolved from the compacts (up to 900Â°C). The pumping system must be capable of safely removing this hydrogen.
The sintering system needs to have the ability to actively cool the material from the sintering temperature at a controlled rate. Appropriate control should be incorporated with the ability to log the process parameters. Temp, Vacuum, oxygen levels, moisture levels, flow rates, power consumption. Ability to set multiple programmes for gas control and temp profiles through PID control. 
ii. Optional Component Technologies
7) The system could incorporate two solvent extraction chambers and pumping systems to remove solvents from the green compacts prior to the sintering process

The new contract is required to ensures service continuity.

The GP provider grouping and location(s) of delivery of the service (number of delivery points) will need to be agreed with the commissioning CCG.

The CCG is commissioning an Extended Hours Service (EHS) that supports its strategic commissioning intentions for:
- Improving patient access to high-quality urgent and routine primary care.
- Improving the patient experience of primary care.
- Promoting the appropriate use of urgent and routine primary care services through the redirection of patients to the right service for their health needs.

We're keen to promote the impact our members have had on the many research and innovation projects managed through VOICE, as well as promoting the breadth of activity types members can get involved in.  To do this effectively we have identified a number of case studies which would be great subjects for professional and promotional case study videos.  Outputs for each case study should include;
o	A 1-2 minute promotional video
o	A series of shorter 'taster' videos for use on social media (Facebook, Twitter & Instagram)

Pause is a licensed programme that is delivered using a social franchising approach. This means that while the programme is delivered by a local delivery organisation it will look, feel and be branded the same as other Pause Practice's in the network.  

Pause is an evidenced based national programme for women who have experienced, and are at risk of experiencing, repeat removals of children from their care. The programme aims to give women the chance to pause and take control of their lives. 

The aim of the Pause service is to give women an opportunity and support to 'pause' and take control over their lives, to improve their wellbeing, resilience and stability. This helps them set in place strong foundations on which they can build a more positive future for themselves. 

The service will contribute to a reduction in future numbers of infants brought into care and the disruption of trans-generational cycles of poor outcomes experienced by some of the most vulnerable families in our community.

Women who experience repeat removals often have complex needs which are not currently being addressed.  They experience trauma and grief associated with the removal of their children, they may suffer from domestic abuse, mental health illnesses or substance misuse and they may have built up a mistrust towards children's social care services, resulting in poor engagement with existing support services.  

Tenders are welcome from:
1. Delivery partner - either a single provider model or a lead provider model (partners who wish to collaborate together for the provision of this service, where the contract is between the commissioner and the lead provider).
2. Social outcomes partnerships - a provider organisation(s) may seek to source and work with a social outcomes partnership/investment bond funding provider.

The intention of the new fencing is to prevent anyone from gaining access to the edge of the top deck of the car park by way of a complete 2.5m high barrier in all locations. The contractor must ensure that any ledges or foot holds are avoided as well as any means to bypass the fencing where if this is the case (for example adjacent stairwells where the profile of the building chamfers in) infills may be required.

The Main Contractor is required to programme and co-ordinate the work of any subcontractors and should plan for the works to be completed in 6 weeks.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Future Research Assessment Programme has been initiated at the request of UK and devolved government ministers and funding bodies. This significant piece of work is led by the four UK higher education funding bodies (Research England, Scottish Funding Council, Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and Department for the Economy, NI) and aims to explore possible approaches to the assessment of UK higher education research performance.

One strand of the programme involves reviewing the costs and benefits of REF 2021 for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and comparing them with those reported for REF 2014 and the RAE 2008  (available from Technopolis Group Â» REF Accountability Review: Costs, benefits and burden (technopolis-group.com) , Preparing impact submissions for REF 2014: An evaluation: Approach and Evidence | RAND  and  Preparing impact submissions for REF 2014: An evaluation: Findings and observations | RAND) where applicable. 

This project should enable funding bodies and HEIs to understand how the balance of costs - against benefits played out in REF 2021 and the impact of changes made between REF 2014 and REF 2021. These insights will contribute towards policy development for future research assessment exercises. 

To meet the requirements of this project, the project will involve working with a representative sample of HEIs to identify how REF submission preparation was managed within institutions, deriving suitable and robust methodologies for gathering quantitative and qualitative data, and analysing them. It will also be necessary to compare the findings between the different REF exercises in a consistent and fair manner; accounting for or explaining gaps in the analysis where it was not possible to make comparisons and explaining the reasons for such judgements.  

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the RFP document.

We are looking to commence the procurement of a solution in July 2022, full implementation and decommissioning of the existing system by December 2025. The current system is over 25 years old.  DCC is keen to use this opportunity to alter its working practices to increase efficiency, visibility, access and integration within the authority and for wider stakeholders. 

We want to ensure that we source a finance system that is going to inform DCC of best practice and provide efficient and effective ways of working.  The solution will be a driver of change for us, rather than be a system adapted to suit our current ways of working. We are keen that the organisation we work with is a market leader and works to deliver technology that will develop with us, ensuring continuous improvement and fit with other Council systems. 

Alongside the new system, as part of a gateway review process, we are looking to bring in external expertise to the planning and delivery of the project. it is proposed that the project bring in a third party, at critical points, to provide external scrutiny and an impartial view of risks and progress.  

We would like to procure a single organisation with strong knowledge of recent financial system implementations at County Council level to provide this support to us. This advice would need to be system agnostic, and the provider should not have an interest in either bidding for the system implementation, the system chosen for procurement, or in the implementation partner chosen alongside the system to implement it with us.  The work will consist of a number of reviews for us commencing June 2022 and completing no later than December 2025.

The PFI Contractor has alerted the Authority to variation notices issued by the Environment Agency requiring variations to the environmental permits of both facilities. The variations to the permits require the facilities to meet the sector specific Best Available Technique conclusions (BATc), as set out in the Waste Treatment BAT reference document (BREF). The variations are likely to require significant alterations to the facilities (including long periods of shutdown). The Council is procuring specific technical advice to assist the Authority through the changes to the facilities. Such services will likely include (but not limited to):

i) advising on the different facility alteration options presented by the PFI Contractor;
ii) assessing the potential risks to the Authority with respect to options proposed for alternations to the facilities;
iii) evaluating/analysing the costs presented by the PFI Contractor for proposed facility alternations; 
iv) assessing the reasonableness of proposed works/shutdown periods;
v) undertaking surveys on the facilities; and
vi) provide technical assistance in any updates to the PFI Contract (e.g. method statements, maintenance plans, etc.)

This service will meet the needs of individuals rough sleeping and those at risk of rough sleeping. The service will work cross mental and physical health, adult social care and local authority homelessness services to ensure individuals receive the support they need to move off the streets and into the homeless pathway.

The Initial Term of the Contract will be for 2 Years 9 months commencing on the 1 July 2022 to 31 March 2025, but with a proviso in the Contract documentation for the LCRCA to have an option to extend the Contract up to a maximum of 3 years, after the Initial Term. The Contract will be monitored throughout the Initial Term and extension period of the Contract.

The value of the contract could be Â£502,864.69 (for 2022-2025) but this is subject to funding and may decrease depending on the outcome of Rough Sleeper Initiative submission for 2022-2025. The funding is expected to cover the period of 1 July 2022 - 31 March 2025 ('Initial Term').  After this time, if there is continued funding from DLUHC for RSI to enable us to continue with the Assertive Outreach Service, then it is possible that the LCRCA may wish to extend the Contract up to a maximum of three years (as one three-year extension or as three one-year extensions, depending on how funding is awarded).  

The Service Provider should note that figures are therefore for guidance purposes only and are subject to change.  Service Providers should therefore place no reliance on this and should realistically and competitively tender for the services.

The supplier will need to be familiar with the national policy landscape including net zero strategy and funding streams, in order to identify where this national context aligns with local action.

â¢ Given the breadth of the environmental policy space it is not expected that suppliers will have expert knowledge in all potential subject areas however knowledge of a wide range of key themes highlighted within the LCR Pathway to Net Zero is essential. The supplier will be expected to possess insight on potential environmental themes, technologies and approaches to ensure that the Plan is cognisant of latest industry and academic thinking.

Total contract length is anticipated to be 4 months (subject to agreement). In order to meet our internal governance criteria, it will be necessary for a final draft Delivery Plan to be produced by end August 2022. A short extension to the contract might be considered, if necessary.
