PH0001,Contract,"North Northamptonshire Council",Awarded,2024-02-26T10:23:42Z,"Participatory Budgetting implmentation","The Well Northants programme aims to empower communities so they can become more connected, more resilient and improve their wellbeing and is key to addressing health inequalities. Public Health and the Communities Teams in West and North Northamptonshire Councils have recruited six community development workers who will work with communities who are most vulnerable to poor health outcomes, such as those who are living in areas of deprivation, isolation and 'inclusion health' groups, who are extremely vulnerable. The Community Development Workers will work with communities in their target areas to understand local needs and what is available locally already, and then work in partnership with those communities to develop interventions to improve health and wellbeing.

The six most deprived areas in the county were identified using IMD, 2019. This programme of work will be key to the levelling up agenda, and the anti-poverty strategy. Four community development workers will take a focus on these areas, two each. A further two workers, one for the West and one for the North will work with inclusion health groups. All of these workers have now started.

The initiative will include a grants programme to enable local communities to coproduce interventions that meet the identified needs of people in each community. 

Grants
The CDWs will have access to a pot of money to issue grants to use to put in place interventions to address local need and these will be designed in partnership with communities. Empowering communities is central to this programme and so we are proposing to use participatory budgeting, which directly involves communities in making decisions about how to spend public money. 

West and North Northamptonshire Councils do not have a current participatory budgeting policy and do not have any experience of issuing funding in this way. Therefore, we are looking for an expert in this way of working to support us to develop policy and processes for using participatory budgeting and to facilitate participatory budgeting workshops in the community, working closely with the community development workers. This is to specifically support the Well Northants project.

The assistance will help equip the GoU with the necessary analytical tools, policy recommendations, and communication support to develop an institutionally coordinated PFM policy tailored to the circumstances of the ongoing war.

The BBC's freehold and leasehold property assets are consolidated into the DCMS group accounts at fair value (as defined in IAS 16 and IFRS 13) under the Government's Financial Reporting Manual (FReM).

The BBC commission Lambert Smith Hampton to value its freehold and leasehold properties on a cyclical basis in accordance with the FReM. As part of our audit the NAO requires an explicit conclusion, based on reasonably sufficient and appropriate procedures over each property within the sample of assets, as to whether the valuation reached by BBC and LSH is within a reasonable range.

The NAO requires specialist valuation support (an auditor expert) to reperform an independent valuation of the sampled assets. As part of completing this engagement, the auditor expert will:
• review the valuation reports and valuation model/calculations provided by BBC and LSH;
• review the explicit/implicit (including completeness of) assumptions supporting the BBC's valuation;

• arrange and undertake physical inspections, to understand the particular properties and determine a valuation range.

The Adult Education Budget (AEB) aims to engage adults and provide the skills and learning they need to equip them for work, an apprenticeship or other learning. It enables more flexible tailored programmes of learning to be made available, which may or may not require a qualification, to help eligible learners engage in learning, build confidence, and/or enhance their wellbeing.

The screening and treatment for a MHTR are commissioned by the Health & Justice team, as part of NHSE/I London's Specialised Commissioning division.

The Service
The provider would screen women who had been referred by either Probation, Defence or Liaison and Diversion who are potentially suitable for a MHTR. If the individual agrees, this will be shared with Probation who will include the recommendation into the Pre Sentence Report for the Judiciary for them to consider whether a MHTR could be part of any sentencing options. Where a woman is given a MHTR as part of a community order the provider would deliver a number of sessions over a specified period, determined by the court and provide psychological treatment/interventions, to address the underlying mental health issues which may be contributing towards the underlying offending issues. The Provider will work directly with probation around support which will increase compliance, as well as proactively support the woman to comply with the MHTR, and therefore reduce breaches. This service would be available to any woman appearing in any of the Magistrates' Courts or Crown Courts in London.

The provider would be expected to work closely with Liaison and Diversion Services across London, as well as the Probation Service, Courts, substance misuse providers and third sector. Where a woman has additional needs, working with the Probation Service, will support her to access appropriate services to support her to address those needs.

Contract Length and value:

The contract for the Service will be awarded for a period of 3 years (36 months), with an optional extension for a further period of 2 years (24 months). Therefore, the maximum duration of this contract, if all extension options are taken up will be 5 years (60 months).

The maximum available annual contract value for this project is £620,000 per annum.
Over the 5 years, if contract is extended to its full duration, the total maximum contract value will be £3,100,000.
The annual payments will be subject to inflationary uplifts in line with published NHS national planning guidance.

The aim of the project is to provide tools to inform offshore wind planning, to minimise impacts on the natural environment through avoidance and early awareness of likely mitigation / compensation needs, allowing sustainable expansion of offshore wind. This will be achieved through the collection of strategic environmental baseline data and updated spatial models for key species (receptors), assemblages, and a suite of ecological metrics (diversity, functional traits). These will be used to identify regions that are most vulnerable to offshore wind impact and mapping of the environmental risk to help guide future offshore wind development rounds and to feed into wider marine planning.
This procurement is sub-divided into 2 Lots as set out in the Specification of Requirements. Tenderers must make clear which Lot they are bidding for. Each Lot will be evaluated separately.

We have outlined one project (Lot 1) to analyse Europe&apos;s security of natural gas supply in winter 2022/23 and a second project (Lot 2) on the contract structures in the global Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) market

A key aim of these research projects will be to consider how the global LNG market may fair under certain stress tests and the implications of this for European energy security. This will involve an understanding of future supply and demand projections under various future scenarios as well as the contracting arrangements in the current and future LNG markets. This will allow the UK to have an evidence-based understanding of how, and to what extent, the LNG market will be able to serve the UK and Europe over the coming winter, 2022/2023 and beyond.

The research will be split into two Lots:

Lot 1:
- Project 1a: Analysis of LNG availability to Europe - focussed on global and regional LNG markets under different outlooks and consideration of key events which could stress the LNG market and the implications for availability of LNG to European markets; and
- Project 1b: European Energy Security Assessment - requiring a contractor to review and validate the assumptions of a European gas market model tool created by BEIS to ensure it is fit for purpose and draws on best available evidence

The supplier will deliver the end-to-end service, including the sourcing of products, management of the user interface(s) and the delivery of products directly to organisations.

The DfE's 2018 omnibus survey found that 83% of secondary school leaders reported making free period products available to pupils, with 41% doing so because of a reason related to pupils' inability to afford period products. Of the secondary school leaders who reported making free products available, 78% said provision was funded from school budgets, 26% used charitable donations and 17% said teachers funded products themselves.

No-one should be held back from reaching their potential, which is why we announced a scheme to provide access to free period products in schools and colleges in England, which is fully funded by the government. On 20 January 2020, the DfE launched the national period products scheme for all state maintained schools and 16-19 education organisations. Period product scheme for schools and colleges in England - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) .

In January 2022, DfE announced that 68% of eligible organisations had accessed the scheme since it began, including 90% of eligible secondary schools. Period Products Scheme: 2021 Management Information (publishing.service.gov.uk)

This contract is as a result of a tendering opportunity to find a single national supplier who can from September 2022:
- Source an appropriate range of period products including environmentally friendly products
- Design and implement user interfaces and support services
- Plan and execute a national delivery service

•	Advise the Mayor of Greater Manchester and the Greater Manchester Lead for Ageing and Equalities of the challenges and opportunities faced by people linked to their identity.

As part of the Government's levelling up agenda Homes England's remit is expected to shift to a focus on place-based regeneration that will see us working closely with other public sector bodies. It will be important that we can improve our ability to link up our development and investment interventions in a particular place through spatial capability.
Place based regeneration may see us taking on sites that are mixed use - i.e. include commercial and other elements as well as residential.

Our objective is to increase and accelerate the delivery of new homes built annually in England to assist Government in meeting their housing delivery ambitions (a target of 300,000 new homes per year by the mid-2020s. 243,770 new homes were completed in England in 2019/20).

To achieve this, we need to find more efficient ways to work that provide joined up systems enabling us to work seamlessly across our programme. This will be achieved by enabling access to common data and information, streamlining (LEAN) our existing processes and /or the implementation of new digital systems.

It has an annual expenditure of over GBP 900 million on goods and services and a population of 1.3 million. The Council provides a wide range of personal and strategic services on behalf of its residents, operating in partnership with 12 district councils and 305 parish/town councils.

The framework is to enable the procurement and delivery of significant Property Infrastructure including new builds, extensions, refurbishments and alterations to its estate. The majority of this is existing schools; however any type of building work to any property including housing, and associated construction services such as hard or soft landscaping is included. A framework is to be established with up to four Suppliers to deliver the pipeline of work based on a rotation approach.

There is no guarantee of work within this Framework and the Client reserves the right to competitively tender any future project it deems appropriate. Call-off arrangement will be based on the NEC 4 suite of contracts with the framework covering the South East of England.

This framework will support the Infrastructure Property Building programme. Projects will be are proposed to be awarded on the basis of rotation, with the opportunity to run a mini-competition process, should it be required. This is at the discretion of the Client.

The primary objective of the Client is to create sustainable relationships while increasing flexibility and agility when commissioning new projects. However work will only be awarded should a Contractor be meeting its Key Performance Indicators and demonstrate value for money for each scheme. The framework pricing structure will be open book, with the Client able to award to the next Supplier should these conditions not be met.

Suppliers may be appointed to provide either 'Professional Services', 'Design, Build and Operate' schemes or 'Construction' schemes throughout the framework period. Where there is a two stage appointment, the Client will reserve the right to award the build element of the project if value for money is not identified. Working closely in a collaborative partnership will help identify the build costs. Awards can be based on either a two stage appointment (where Early Contractor Involvement is required) or a single stage appointment (where Early Contractor Involvement is not required).

The Supplier will usually procure the specialist organisations such as M&E, Glazing, Roofing, Groundwork's etc who will work as Sub-Contractors. Minimum project builds will be worth £1m with no maximum limit. A detailed pipeline has been provided in the documentation to provide prospective candidates project values expected through this framework.

A lot has been learnt from their usage, but more is needed to build on this investment and scale to support the demand, standardised ways of working and the security profile. This is backed up by Analytics being recognised as one of the common reusable services in Digital's Enterprise Architecture. 
Post-Covid the user demands for these platforms significantly increased primarily in response to the Fraud and Error responses as well as operational performance. This has resulted in a need for more data quicker, increased cloud elasticity for greater response times, support for a greater number of users with a lower barrier of entry, increased collaboration between teams and the flexibility to innovate with new tools. 
A partner was brought in to develop this service and accelerate our cloud adoption as DWP did not have enough capacity or skills in order to complete the work itself. Kainos were awarded the contract and have built a series of MVPs deployed to production and have provided that live running service.

East Midlands Development Corporation (EM DevCo) programme is a ground-breaking initiative that will bring transformational development and infrastructure to an entire region. It emerged out of the East Midlands HS2 Growth Strategy published in September 2017 as a delivery vehicle to maximise the benefits for scalable development and infrastructure investment for the East Midlands region. EM DevCo is a company limited by guarantee owned by 5 member local authorities including Nottinghamshire County Council (host); Leicestershire County Council, Broxtowe Borough Council, Rushcliffe Borough Council and North West Leicestershire District Council.
As an interim vehicle, EM DevCo was established and anticipated to exist in its current state, until any successor statutory development corporation is brought into effect, and this was anticipated to take up to three years at company's inception in 2021. The services outlined in this scope of works will be procured for the duration of the life of the company as a call-off arrangement with appropriate review points and notice periods to be subject to contract.
As EM DevCo enters its second year with the benefit of additional resources from the UK Government, the company needs to appoint a legal team for the duration of the interim vehicle prior to the establishment of the statutory development corporation (""EMDC"") to support in four key areas.",,,England,"79100000 ",,shanen.irwin@nottscc.gov.uk,"County Hall","Loughborough Road Westbridgford",Nottinghamshire,"NG2 7QP",England,"'+44 1158546223",http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk,,,,01/07/2022,01/07/2024,13/06/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,300000,300000,30/06/2022,300000,"[Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP|4 More London Riverside, London, SE1 1AU|NONE||No|No]",,01/07/2022,01/07/2024,"Other ",,14:00

The microchip named mignon was fabricated in early 2021 and this work was led by Dr Rishad Shafik and Professor Alex Yakovlev of the Microsystems Group, School of Engineering at Newcastle University.

The aim is to create a Fabless IP based spin-out company mignon.ai which will market and sell the design of customised hardware devices and semiconductor electronics systems all based on the mignon microchip. The company mignon.ai will develop and design the microchips and supply codes to clients to enable the synthesising of microchip, where all manufacturing of hardware will be outsourced.
 
The team requires an experienced and appropriate business executive to progress this opportunity.
The initial brief of the executive will be to:  
(1)	Produce a viable 5 year business plan; 
(2)	Obtain university approval for the venture;
(3)	a.	Act for the company in the spin-out legal process and address all company formation matters;
b.	Obtain founder academics' and Newcastle University (including the Head of Company Creation) approval for appointment as CEO.
c.	Provide to the appropriate university all matters necessary for Research England reporting requirements;
(4)	Secure (venture capital and other) funding
Stage (5) will produce the funds by which the new start-up company can consider employing the executive going forward. It is expected, and the intent of the scheme, that the Executive will remain with the business following the end of the contract period. However, such appointment will be at the discretion of the board and appropriate university and will be subject to confirmation, typically at Stage 4 above.

The Fund has been operational since 2015 and has an external advisory group that meets three times a year to advise on data purchases and research priorities.
      
      A number of ground-breaking studies have been commissioned through the Fund over the past seven years, including: Workforce Diversity Evidence Review; Screen Business (2018 and 2021 editions); A Screen New Deal, Horizon Scan (title TBC); Film in the Wider World (not yet published); and The Impacts of Leaving the EU on the UK's Screen Sector. Other notable outputs include the annual BFI Statistical Yearbook and Official Statistics releases and its well-received 'Insight Exchange' events. There is also an enquiry service whereby data purchased through the Fund is used to respond to queries and data requests from industry, the international screen sector, the press, academics, students and the public.
      
      The BFI wishes to commission an evaluation which will assess the overall impacts of the Research & Statistics Fund, including how it contributes and adds value to the UK screen sector ecosystem.
      
      The evaluation should also examine whether the current aims, objectives and primary delivery methods of the Fund are still fit for purpose. We would like to understand whether our funding is being targeted in the right areas, whether we need to broaden our scope and where we should focus our investment in the future.
      
      The approach should cover both impact and process evaluation.
      
      Full details are set out in the ITT.

       The Metropolitan Police Service is famed around the world and has a unique place in the history of policing. It is by far the largest of the police services that operate in the UK. The Royal Parks Constabulary has now become part of the MPS.
      
      Today, the MPS employs approximately 31,141 officers, 13,661 police staff, 414 traffic wardens and 2,106 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), and, since the realignment of police boundaries in April 2000, it covers an area of 620 square miles and a population of 7.2million.
      
      Staff of the MPS (other than police officers) are employed by the MOPAC (Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime) but the power to appoint and dismiss them vests in the Commissioner. The MPS covers the area broadly within the boundaries of the M25. Day-to-day policing is the responsibility of 32 Borough Operational Command Units supported by centralised specialist policing units and other management, admin and support functions.

The programme places a significant focus upon preventative strategies as well as the de-escalation and defusing elements of supporting behaviour whilst recognising it is sometimes necessary to use physical intervention to hold a service user to protect their wellbeing and the welfare of others. The model offers staff a 'toolbox' of skills and strategies to better deal with the everyday occurring situations that can escalate and develop into conflict, without compromising the ultimate welfare and safety of the service user or staff member.

Aycliffe Secure Centre was involved in the development of PRICE, responding to concerns about the safety and welfare of looked after children and young people, in relation to how their behaviour was being physically managed in residential establishments. The Service has been using the system for over 20 years. 

A ""train the trainer"" model is used by PRICE. Trainers within Durham County Council who are competent and capable users of PRICE techniques are trained and provided with annual refresher training by PRICE so they can train others. 

This contract should allow for both initial and refresher ""train the trainer"" courses as required over the period.

It was recommended in Feasibility that two options are taken forward for further development. These options are 'individual user delay' and 'delay index'. Both options will make enhancements to the current delay from roadworks performance indicator to include delays on diversion routes and delays experienced by customers upstream to or in close proximity to roadworks. It is essential that the metric can be influenced by operational levers of National Highways in order to improve performance.

Under the legislation is called the Children and Families Act 2014 and the Care Act 2014 Local Authorities must assess whether young carers have support needs and take 'reasonable steps' to identify and try to provide for those support needs. 

The level of care is defined as providing regular and ongoing care and emotional support to a family member who is physically or mentally ill, disabled or misuses substances. The range and scale of caring varies greatly. It can involve lots of physical care including personal care, giving medication, and helping someone to dress or move around. It can be looking after siblings, paying bills, cooking, cleaning, shopping, or translating.  Some young carers give no physical care but provide emotional support, particularly for someone who has a mental health condition or misuses substances.

The Council wish to commission a Provider to process referrals from its 'front door' using its young carer assessment process and toolkit and identify appropriate support for individual young carers in Northumberland. Further details of the Contracting Authority's requirements under the Contract and other relevant information are detailed in the Specification at Schedule 2.

tender_308106/1078017,Contract,"West Midlands Combined Authority",Awarded,2022-06-22T15:10:03+01:00,"VEAT Notice for Bus Contingency Provision during the Commonwealth Games","This is a VEAT Notice, not an opportunity listing.

There is a risk that industrial action on the UK rail network may coincide with the Commonwealth Games, which will be hosted in the West Midlands between 28 July and 9 August. On the busiest days, over 100,000 rail trips, as part of a journey to and from the Games, are predicted.

The transport plan for the Games' venues indicates that approximately 40% of workforce and spectators would be expected to travel to the Games events by train.  A contingency plan is therefore required should the rail network be unavailable, or severely reduced, due to industrial action.

This contingency plan is being developed by the Transport for West Midlands Team of the West Midlands Combined Authority (""WMCA"") on behalf of the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee.  A key element of the contingency plan is to provide additional bus services within the West Midlands region, to provide additional shuttle services between venues, city centres and Park & Ride sites.  Another important aspect is the provision of additional coach capacity from towns and cities across the UK, replacing the connections that would otherwise be offered by the rail network.

Market assessment to identify and source additional buses and coaches in order to enact the  contingency plan was undertaken at a time when there were and are many other calls on scarce buses, coaches and drivers, to serve other major events, airports, critical workplaces and provide rail replacement services.  As a result, it was critical  that WMCA secure bus operators in the shortest possible time and obtain the maximum number of resources mobilised and ready for 23rd July 2022.  This will allow for driver route training and mobilisation plus Opening ceremony full dress rehearsals 24th and 26th July.

As a consequence of a UK wide rapid market engagement with regional, national bus and coach operators WMCA has found capacity and capability that achieves the most desirable possible outcome given the current restrictions and direct awards, in accordance with Clause 32(2)(C) of the Public Contracting Regulations 2015, will be made at the end of a 10 day standstill period.

This has enabled WMCA to acquire buses, coaches and drivers in the shortest possible time and maximise the resources available to deliver its contingency plan.",,,"West Midlands","60172000 ","West Midlands",Procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,"16 Summer Lane",,Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,'+443453036760,www.wmca.org.uk,,,,25/07/2022,09/08/2022,04/07/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,4068958,,04/07/2022,4068958,"[Adventure Travel|Coaster Place, Cardiff, CF10 4XZ|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Berrys Coaches (Taunton) Ltd|Peter Clifford House, Great Western Way, Taunton, Somerset|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Chalkwell Coach Hire|The Coach Depot, Unit 2a Church Road, Sittingbourne, Kent, ME10 3RS|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Coach Events Services Ltd|7 Bournemouth Road, Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, SO53 3DA|NONE_OTHER||No|No][First South West Limited|Union Street, Camborne, Cornwall, TR14 8HF|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Go South Coast Ltd|Towngate House, 2-8 Parkstone Road, Poole, Dorset, BH15 2PR|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Holmeswood Coaches Ltd|Sandy Way, Holmeswood, Lancashire, L40 1UB|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Johnsons Coach & Bus Travel|Liveridge House, Liveridge Hill, Henley in Arden, Warwickshire, CV5 9LT|NONE_OTHER||No|No][London General Transport Services Limited|No.18 Merton High Street, London, Merton, SW19 1DN|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Newport Transport Ltd|160 Corporation Road, Newport, Gwent, NP19 0WF|NONE_OTHER||No|No][R.E Morris & Sons Ltd|The Garage, Oswestry, Shropshire, SY10 0AD|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Reading Buses|Great Knollys Street, Reading, Berkshire, RG1 7HH|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Stephensons of Essex|Riverside Industrial Estate, South Street, Rochford, Essex, SS4 1BS|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Dews Coaches|Chatteris Road, Cambs, Cambridgeshire, PE28 3DN|NONE_OTHER||No|No][D&G Bus Ltd|Mossfield Road, Stoke-on-Trent, Stoke-on-Trent, ST3 5BW|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Notts & Derby Buses|The Bus Depot, Meadow Road, Derby, Derbyshire, DE1 2BH|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Peoplebus Ltd|PO Box 57, Liverpool, Merseyside, L9 8YX|NONE_OTHER||No|No][Roberts Travel Group|The Limes, Midland Road, Hugglescote, Coalville, Leicestershire, LE67 2FX|NONE_OTHER||No|No][West Midlands Travel Ltd|National Express House,  Digbeth,  Birmingham,  B5 6DD|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,25/07/2022,09/08/2022,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,23:59
