Teleradiology offers trusts an alternative to manage routine, urgent or specialist workload, and supports with the reduction of backlogs in care. 

Teleradiology is the transmission of patients' radiological images between different locations for the production of a primary report, expert second opinion or clinical review. Telepathology is the electronic transmission of pathological images, usually derived from microscopes, from one location to another, for the purpose of interpretation and diagnosis. The different locations can be within the same organisation or in different organisations, within the same country or across international boundaries.

Other areas of telemedicine are also now being explored, including but not limited to telepathology, telemicrobiology and teledermatology. The scope of this agreement will include these and other specialties of telemedicine to allow for expansion into new services during the term of the agreement, to help support the NHS with elective recovery. 

Radiology workflow management systems are designed to improve productivity and efficiency in radiology departments. As business intelligence systems they allow precise forecasting of reporting capacity, enabling optimisation of departmental rotas and highlight areas for strategic recruitment based on supply and demand. These systems can reduce the costs of outsourcing and support radiology departments to operate as efficiently as possible. 

Proposed Framework
The Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, through its Commercial Procurement Services, wishes to award a national framework agreement with three Lots:

      King George Recreation Ground is an award winning destination park which is busy at all times of the day with dog walkers, children and families all enjoying the wide range of facilities and features. These include a cafÃ©, splash park, large play area, bowling green, table tennis tables, outdoor fitness equipment and multi-sports court. Continuing improvements to the park provide opportunities for everyone to benefit from this valuable community resource in the heart of Bushey. The refurbishment of the tennis courts is the latest of these.
      The current tennis courts opened in Spring 1998 with the most recent court markings overlaid in 2013 and some repairs to cracks and dips in 2014. The tennis courts, being constantly used, even in the winter months, are now beginning to show a lot of wear and tear over their surface and it is clear that the courts now require full refurbishment.
      A range of options have been discussed with the Lawn Tennis Association who have advised on consultation and specifications for the work and in November 2021, Hertsmere Borough Council Executive Committee approved the project to tender for the refurbishment and enlargement to LTA competition standard of all 4 tennis courts along the construction of a retaining wall and the installation of 2 electronic gates to control access to authorised and booked use only.",,"WD6 1WA","Any region","43325000 45236112 37452720 ","Margaret Haynes (HBC)",margaret.haynes@hertsmere.gov.uk,"Elstree Way",Borehamwood,Hertfordshire,"WD6 1WA","United Kingdom","0208 207 2277",www.hertsmere.gov.uk,,,,11/09/2022,13/02/2023,05/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Works,237731.77,237731.77,09/09/2022,237731.77,"[Chiltern Sports Contractors|Honours Yard, Lodge Lane, Chalfiont St Giles , United Kingdom, HP8 4AJ|NONE||No|No]",,11/09/2022,13/02/2023,"Open ",,17:00

It is MSE ICB&apos;s intention to award this contract to the existing supplier, NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit (AGEM CSU) for the provision of Corporate IT Service Management to Mid and South Essex integrated Care Board.

The national guidance confirms that Commissioning support units (CSUs) operate within the NHS family across England, providing services that have been independently evaluated for quality and value for money. The expectation is that CSUs will continue to develop as trusted delivery partners to ICSs, providing economies of scale.

Nationally NHS England have put in place a moratorium to protect core CSU services whilst clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are dissolved and transitioned to ICB. No definitive date has been given for when the protected status will end.

The ICB have concluded that there is an unacceptable risk associated with change of service provision whilst the system is in a significant state of transition and valuable resources must be duly focused on ensuring Business as Usual (BAU) services and steady state across the new MSE ICB. The ICB deem that the incumbent provider is the only technically capable provider to deliver the services within the timescale and budget available. Additionally, there is insufficient time to complete a robust contract mobilisation, involving critical mobilisation and transition risks including workforce and transfer of data and systems, which is estimated to require 12+ months to implement in a robust and safe manner, based on previous experience. In the face of current ICB transition environment and in the absence a longer mobilisation period, no reasonable alternative or substitute exists.

MSE ICB have decided that the best solution to ensure that corporate users across Mid and South Essex benefit from Corporate IT Service Management is to ensure continuity of service provision with the existing supplier, who is uniquely placed to successfully deliver Corporate IT Service Management in accordance with the NHS England Moratorium and the available timescales. As such the ICB propose to award a contract to AGEM CSU for the provision of Corporate IT Service Management, service delivery (with the option to extend by a further 12 months).

KENT001-DN626053-89946435,Contract,"Kent County Council",Awarded,2022-12-20T14:17:37Z,"SC22223 - C-Care Technology Resilience Voucher Scheme","C-Care is cross-Channel Interreg project which aims to respond to some of the socio-economic 
challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. C-Care is led by Kent County Council and 
involves 3 other English and 3 French partner organisations who are jointly implementing the 
project. C-Care will provide support to businesses and individuals at risk of exclusion in the 
France-Channel England area to aid economic recovery.

As part of this project, the Growth & Communities Division within GET is leading on a technology 
resilience voucher pilot scheme to provide support to Kent businesses. The scheme was launched 
in November 2021 when Kent SMEs could start to apply for vouchers. A framework of suppliers 
was procured during the summer of 2021 which resulted in seven suppliers being selected and 
approved to provide services to Kent businesses under the voucher scheme. A total number of 
385 applications were received between November 2021 and June 2022 and 320 were approved. 
However, 74 (23.12%) of these which have been withdrawn - the main reason being given by 
SMEs was a lack of a suitable supplier on the framework to deliver the service they wanted. Not 
every lot was filled by suppliers and only 4 of the 7 suppliers have actually been selected by 
beneficiary SMEs to complete a voucher project. Some current suppliers have also indicated that 
they are very near to reaching full capacity to deliver voucher projects.

The aim is to provide a representative picture of how Swedish / Irish employers of all sizes and sectors are supporting good mental health and well-being among their workforces. We are also interested in how this is impacting on business performance and other aspects of firms' operations. 
      
      LOT 1 - The Swedish project is being funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). 
      LOT 2 - University College Cork would be the named Irish contact for this project. UCC are partnering in this project with the University of Warwick and University of Nottingham. The project is being funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). 
      
      The central element of the projects will be a telephone (CATI) survey of employers. We are keen to survey a large group of firms (c. 1500) in each territory and to be able to consider sectoral and regional contrasts in mental health and well-being practices. We envisage the surveys being conducted over the period September to October 2022. Suppliers are required to tender for all elements of the project within each LOT but do not have to bid for both LOT's unless they have the required experience in each territory.
      
      Survey requirements may expand and evolve over time, so we will be looking to work with the winning supplier(s) to put in place a call-off Agreement for any subsequent follow-on surveys for each LOT. 
      
      The call-off Agreement covers items within the scope of this tender and will be provided under the same terms and conditions. The call-off Agreement will run for a period of 1 plus 1 plus 1 years. The additional years will be offered if the chosen supplier(s) are performing successfully, the University of Warwick receives funding for future surveys and the optional pricing is economically advantageous. 
      
      This Part Two tender document sets out the services requirement and evaluation criteria for each LOT. Please ensure you read in conjunction with the other parts of the complete tender document set.

1.1.1.	The Fisheries Act (2020) places an obligation on Defra and the devolved administrations to prepare and publish Fisheries Management Plans (FMPs) to help achieve Defra's ambition for sustainable fisheries. The Act describes an FMP as a document that sets out policies designed to restore one or more stocks of sea fish to, or maintain them at, sustainable levels.

1.1.2.	Once a FMP is published, the Act places a duty on national fisheries authorities to exercise their functions in accordance with the policies set out in FMPs. The plans therefore place binding obligations onto the national fisheries authorities to seek to deliver the goals of each FMP.

1.1.3.	Each FMP will be reviewed at least every six years to ensure that they remain effective, although fisheries policy authorities can carry out more frequent and regular reviews on policies within the plans when considered appropriate. The draft Joint Fisheries Statement (JFS) included a list of proposed FMPs with a timetable for their publication. Defra are reviewing the responses to the JFS consultation, and a final list will be published by November 2022.

1.1.4.	There are currently 43 planned FMPs:

-	21 are joint UK FMPs which will be jointly developed by all 4 UK administrations, with Scottish Government coordinating their preparation.  
-	2 FMPs coordinated by Northern Ireland published jointly with Welsh Government and Defra.  
-	Defra will be publishing 16 FMPs.
 
1.1.5.	FMPs will be a tool to implement wider policies and work on fisheries management, for example informing Defra's approach when negotiating the management of stocks shared with other coastal states.",,"SW1P 3JR","Any region","03000000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Smith Square",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,http://defra.bravosolutions.co.uk,"ecm_ 66150 - Evaluating the contribution of Fisheries Management Plans Toward Ocean Sustainability (including Collaborative approache Research terms and Conditonsr_Redacted.pdf ",,,05/09/2022,31/03/2025,02/08/2022,YES,tender_309054/1080806,Yes,Yes,No,Services,716910,,05/09/2022,716910,"[ICF Consulting Services Limited|Riverscape, 10 Queen Street Place London.

The model represents a number of Chalk streams that are situated in the Wye, Colne and Lee catchments. These catchments have been previously assessed to suffer from large scale over abstraction through the Catchment Abstraction Management Strategy (CAMS) methodology.
The EA is looking to procure an external contractor to deliver Phase 2 of the project, which will deliver the Formulation of Revised Conceptual Model. This phase will refresh the existing foundation conceptual models and merge them into a single conceptual model that will then be updated. This will then support proposals for further development of the model in Phase 3.
The objectives of Phase 2 are:
1. To refresh the existing foundation conceptual models and merge them into a single conceptual model

2. To gather and review necessary datasets and literature to support merged conceptual model update, reporting on initial model conceptual model uncertainty and data gaps

3. To expand the conceptual model where new data and literature is available for several concepts such as influence of superficial deposits, karstic development, evidence of hydrogeological layering within the Chalk

4. To report on the updated conceptual model and make recommendations for development and refinement of numerical model in MODFLOW 6 (Phase 3)",,,"Any region","72242000 ",XX,procurement@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,'+443001234500,www.defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Project_36144_Contract_Hertfordshire Chalk Groundwater Model Phase 2_Redacted.pdf ",,,19/08/2022,05/06/2023,13/05/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,08/09/2022,76722,"[Stantec UK Limited|New  Zealand House, 160-162 Abbey Foregate, Shrewsbury SY2 6FD|COMPANIES_HOUSE|1188070|No|No]",,19/08/2022,05/06/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00

Symptoms include urgency (a sudden compelling desire to pass urine, which cannot be deferred), increased frequency of voiding (both day and night) and urge incontinence (involuntary leakage accompanied by / immediately preceded by urgency).\r
\r
The Team wishes to establish a spinout company to produce a Dipstick-style test. Our discovery is currently being developed into a simple-to-use diagnostic tool used for (1) regular screening for OAB in adults, at a GP surgery, pharmacy or nursing home, and (2) to assess the effectiveness of treatments (companion diagnostic) and modifying dosing/treatments accordingly. Accurate and early diagnosis will improve treatment outcomes, eliminating the need for patients to have invasive and high-risk surgery-led second-line treatments necessary for advanced-stage disease.\r
\r
Currently there is no competition for a non-invasive biomarker-based test, and new product development activity appears to be very limited, suggesting an opportunity for 'first mover advantage' and to establish a standard.\r
We require a driven executive to take this technology forward and build a compelling proposition for investment. The Executive will need to create a robust business model that is acceptable to the founders, develop and deliver pitch materials for investors and establish collaborative research projects.\r

Interested organisations should be experienced in engagement with local communities. This can be unrelated to flooding. 

This project is funded by Defra as part of the Â£150 million Flood and Coastal Resilience Innovation Programme which is managed by the Environment Agency to develop and test new approaches to help communities become more resilient to the effects of flooding and climate change.

The aim of the GRACE Programme is, through innovative solutions and stakeholder engagement, to build resilience to groundwater flooding for communities, focusing particularly on 10 at risk geographical areas. 

The provider(s) shall devise and carry out effective and true engagement with stakeholders and local communities to help collaborate on, and co-produce, innovative solutions to groundwater flood risk.  They will work closely with the Engagement and communications workstream.

The contract term is 4.5 years (4 years and 6 months) with the option to extend for 1 year. The work shall be undertaken in 4 phases, with each phase dependent on the council first issuing formal written instructions at its discretion for the relevant work to be undertaken.

The service is divided into 10 geographical areas referred to as Lots. The potential provider(s) can bid for any number of Lots. The 10th area has not yet been agreed and therefore only 9 Lots will be covered by this tender process.

The lots are defined by the pilot communities that the GRACE Programme is focussing upon, namely:

â¢	Lot 1 Bramingham, Bedfordshire
â¢	Lot 2 Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire
â¢	Lot 3 Chesham, Buckinghamshire

â¢	Lot 7 Marlow, Buckinghamshire
â¢	Lot 8 New Hinksey, Oxfordshire
â¢	Lot 9 Pang Valley, Berkshire

A budget of approximately Â£15,000 per area has been allocated for Phase 1. Budget will be allocated for each subsequent phase based on outcome, performance and future plan. The estimated maximum contract value per area is Â£75,000. The total contract value for the 4.5 year period including any extension for the 10 pilot areas is estimated to be Â£750,000.

Our ambition is to fully integrate the image library with the existing Ageing Better website, moving away from using ResourceSpace for public access. This will hopefully ensure more control over the image library and its functionality, an enhanced user experience, and more integration between the image library, the Ageing Better brand and other content that sits on the Ageing Better site.

This project will require back-end and front-end web development work, to add DAM capabilities to the existing Ageing Better Drupal 9.3 website. While the library should be integrated with the Ageing Better website from a front-end perspective, and made clear that this product is part of the website, it will likely exist as a sub-section of the site, with its own navigation and page templates.

We expect the project to be completed within three months of commencement. Bids should not exceed Â£30,000 excl VAT, for custom development and integration of Drupal or 3rd party features.

After a high-profile national campaign, the winners will be decided by public vote, giving National Lottery players and the public a say in how National Lottery money is spent.

The People's Projects relies on the public voting for projects to receive National Lottery funding, so to ensure its success, it is essential for the projects taking part that they receive support and advice around the filming of their project, training on maximising votes through campaigning and general media training. The projects may not be familiar with campaigning for votes or giving media interviews and this training will build capacity and skills for this programme and also in helping equip projects with further skills in this area for their future endeavours.

We are therefore looking to provide face-to-face media and campaign training for all the shortlist and reserve list projects and provide them all with a campaign booklet they can use as a reference guide after the training.

This will be a 7 month contract until 01st May 2023, with the option to extend by a further month. The maximum budget for delivering the Services is Â£90,000 including expenses (excluding VAT).

This contract will be subject to the Fund's standard terms and conditions. These can be accessed via the following link: https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/about/customer-service/supplier-zone/terms-and-conditions (this contract will be subject to our terms and conditions for over Â£10,000). A submission received as part of this tender process shall constitute acceptance of these terms and conditions, so bidders are advised to review these with their legal team whilst the tender is still live.

This procurement follows the Open under the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

The Authority is committed to ensuring their workforce is competent and confident to carry out their responsibilities to both support adults at risk (including its workforce) and is also committed to promoting the mental wellbeing of Isle of Wight residents and expect all staff and volunteers to share in this commitment.

The Authority wants to engage with a supplier that has extensive experience of the delivery of mental health learning & development activities (including Mental Health First Aid and Suicide Prevention).

These activities are offered to a range of learners who are all Isle of Wight based, and therefore the successful supplier is required to be able to provide face to face activities at various locations on the Isle of Wight. This can be at either at an Authority venue or the supplier's venue with the agreement of the Authority. Additionally, the Authority may request that specific venues are used for delivery of the activities such as a particular Authority building; residential care environment; or in a school environment. However, the Authority is also currently supporting virtual delivery and blended approaches therefore the supplier should also have the ability to provide virtual delivery of any or all of the activities.

The current programme includes but is not limited to the following key areas:

â¢ Â½ day Mental Health Awareness

â¢ 1 day Suicide Prevention First Aid Certificate (Nationally accredited)
â¢ Mental Health First Aid (Adult) Refresher
â¢ Youth Mental Health First Aid (for educational settings) (Nationally accredited)

Please note that the above courses are an indication of the types of courses run in the past. The Authority may wish to commission other mental health training as further need is identified.

The successful supplier will need to demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of national legal frameworks, as well as policies and procedures as accredited providers of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention First Aid certification.

Please note that the Authority requires Learning activities to be aimed at a variety of levels when providing the services.

Potential suppliers should note that this is a non-exclusive contract and that there is no guarantee of value or volume of activities.

A large part of the area is not currently provided with bus services - this will be an additional service, which will complement existing services. This pilot DRT service will test how a flexible service, primarily booked through an App, can provide an option that will meet the travel needs of many people whom the current bus network does not serve. Attractive service branding and proactive marketing will seek to attract new users who are currently lacking affordable transport (particularly younger people). 
Whilst the service will introduce new resources into the area (three new accessible vehicles) it will also seek to follow 'Total Transport' principles and make better use of existing vehicles through integration with the local Community Transport projects and potentially the Council's in-house fleet, to enhance the service offer. The service will be fully accessible, enabling easy access for passengers with mobility or sensory impairments.

CReDo aims to be a connected digital twin of critical infrastructure that helps the cross-sectoral infrastructure network adapt to climate change and improve climate resilience. 

CReDo showcases the advantages of combining data and insights across sectoral and organisational boundaries. The resulting improved coordination of operational and investment decisions, including inter- and intra-sector collaboration, will increase resilience against extreme weather events. At present this covers infrastructure across the water, energy and telecoms sectors, but the long-term ambition is to capture additional sectors, at a national scale.

NICEL22,Contract,"National Institute For Health And Care Excellence",Awarded,2022-09-14T12:23:39+01:00,"NICE Listens","The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is the independent organisation responsible for providing national guidance and advice on promoting high quality health, public health and social care.
Our role is to improve outcomes for people using the NHS and other public health and social care services. We do this by:
â¢	Producing evidence-based guidance and advice for health, public health and social care practitioners.
â¢	Developing quality standards and performance metrics for those providing and commissioning health, public health and social care services.
â¢	Providing a range of information services for commissioners, practitioners and managers across the spectrum of health and social care.

NICE and its advisory bodies base their conclusions on the best available evidence but they also have to make judgements. These fall into two categories. Scientific value judgements are concerned with interpreting the significance and relevance of the totality of the available scientific, technical and clinical data. Social value judgements take account of societal aspirations, preferences and ethical principles that ought to underpin the manner and extent of the care provided to NHS patients and users of social care services. 

The advisory groups who formulate the various forms of NICE guidance are well-qualified to make scientific judgements. However, they have no particular legitimacy to impose their own social value judgements on the NHS or social care.  

In the past the NICE Citizens Council provided a mechanism for in-depth, deliberative enquiry with a group of informed members of the public, to help inform the approach and judgements NICE takes. Reports from the Citizens Council have been used to inform the NICE Principles and are reflected in our evaluation methods and decision frameworks. 

NICE and the wider health and social care landscape are changing. In addition to the long-term impacts of COVID-19, transformative innovation is underway in healthcare services, technologies and regulatory science, and within NICE itself. These changes will throw up challenging moral, ethical and social value issues that NICE will need to address. 

In light of these challenges, NICE has introduced a new process for deliberative public engagement: NICE Listens. Whilst performing a similar function to our previous Citizens Council, it offers a more flexible format which can be tailored to different topics and timescales. It complements our existing mechanisms for public engagement but is used to address particularly challenging topics.

NICE is seeking an independent external contractor to support the recruitment for, design, set-up, facilitation and evaluation of a NICE Listens event. NICE staff will work with the successful contractor to design and develop the event.",,,"North West,London","73000000 ","Irene Walker",irene.walker@nice.org.uk,"Level 1 City Tower",,Manchester,M14BT,"United Kingdom","020 7045 2024",https://www.nice.org.uk/,"Tender Pack NICE Listens.zip ",,,25/07/2022,31/01/2023,07/06/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,0,50000,09/09/2022,49813,"[BASIS RESEARCH LIMITED|HANWAY HOUSE,24 HANWAY STREET

"Fusion ITTH61",Contract,"LONDON BOROUGH OF HAVERING",Awarded,2022-09-09T11:47:48+01:00,"Support to Independence Service at Heather Court","Heather Court is owned by Look Ahead Care and Support (Look Ahead). It comprises 15 selfcontained units with onsite facilities for support staff. Placements at Heather Court are via referral (both from Havering's Leaving Care Team and external sources such as self-referral and other housing providers) discussed at monthly panel meetings. Heather Court provides a valuable resource to support young people to achieve full independence in Havering and is an important element of the wider portfolio of options for providing young people with supported accommodation. Havering has a need for supported accommodation for young people who are leaving care, at risk, offending or at risk of offending or misusing substances. Equally, young people leaving the family home after irretrievable family breakdown or abusive situations have needs of supported accommodation within Havering.
Heather Court remains strategically relevant for the Council because it provides a valuable resource where young people can be supported to achieve full independence. LB Havering seeks to retain this supported housing scheme as part of the wider portfolio of options for young people in Havering. The building, not directly a part of this contract, is still a valuable resource for the Council and this cohort of young people. Young people, with exception of those leaving care, are not given any priority through housing lists to socially rented properties and the private sector is largely closed to them
through lack of deposit, mistrust by landlords and general affordability criteria. Equally, many young people do not just require a housing solution but need support to help get their lives back on track.
Heather Court accommodates young people aged 16 (subject to guarantor agreement) to 25 years of age - the majority of current residents/service users are young people leaving care or young people at risk and are aged 21 or under and have a mix of capabilities. The support service is able to address a percentage of young people at any one time with relatively complex needs such as substance misuse, chaotic lifestyles and/or issues around offending or risk of offending. Experience suggests the specific mix of individual tenants at any given time can have a significant impact on the day to day management of the overall scheme. Residents at Heather Court are supported to stay safe and to achieve their desired outcomes
including gaining the necessary experience and skills required to move on to and be able to manage themselves in independent accommodation. To be eligible for this service, individuals must have an identified need for housing related support services and would
benefit from this service.

Specifically, we would like to assess the LR pilot scheme in England and the removal of Direct Payments over the agricultural transition period. How are farmers preparing for the changes and challenges ahead? Are they engaging with LR? Are they participating in the pilot? Are they planning to expand, diversify or to leave the industry or have they made any plans to mitigate the loss of direct payments? 

There is a high level of interest amongst farmers and growers in knowing how the new ELMs policies will/could work and how it could impact their finances. This project is about providing farmers and growers an understanding of how the LR policy proposals could impact their business and help explore ideas of how to prepare for the change. AHDB is also keen to learn about the views of farmers and growers that are not taking part in the LR, as well as where they receive information regarding policy change and in which format. 

The aim of this project is to inform farmers and growers of how farm businesses are adapting to the changes in policy. Related to this are the following objectives:
â¢	What are the key factors LR participants have taken into consideration in their planning that others can learn from? 
â¢	How do farmers expect LR will impact on their farm business finances - what are the expected costs and benefits?
â¢	Is there a difference in attitude between the more progressive farmers/growers and others?
â¢	What are the farmers attitudes towards collaborating on environmental issues?
â¢	How do farmers feel LR could be improved?
â¢	What are the barriers to participating in LR?
â¢	How is the collaborative partnership managed? 
The number of participants in this study should be skewed towards those that are taking part in the LR. AHDB requires in-depth qualitative information from these participants, and this may be obtained via case studies. The following sectors need to be represented:
â¢	Beef
â¢	Sheep
â¢	Pork
â¢	Dairy
â¢	Cereals and Oilseeds
In total, AHDB expects at least three in-depth qualitative reports/examples covering the criteria outlined above and at least one in-depth qualitative report of a large-scale group of farmers, such as within a National Park or similar who have chosen not to participate in LR. Please note that this study due to its size is not intended to be representative of the agricultural sector in England. The intention of the project is to capture initial views and plans regarding LR and is not expected to provide a comprehensive analysis of the scheme.

AHDB invites applicants to provide details/methodologies regarding the identification and recruitment of farmer participants on which the qualitative reports will be based. However, AHDB will assist with locating participants if required.

The Department have appointed a supplier to provide BEIS with tailored data sets of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) with their related Business-As-Usual emissions (BAUs).  
The datasets will need to have broad consistency, as specified and agreed, with BEIS internal assumptions (such as on energy demand, energy supply, policy impact analysis and resulting emissions) under a number of scenarios. These sets are for central, low and high BAU emissions scenarios.  Between the different scenarios, we plan to vary baseline policy assumptions. Additionally, we require sensitivities that vary Fossil Fuel Price and Growth assumptions.

These data and supporting documentation will then be used in analysis to meet these objectives: 
- Evidence to underpin updated UK (short-term) traded carbon values (from the UK BCPM). 
- A robust analytical capability within BEIS to estimate the effects of policy options for the future of emissions trading in the UK and for Net Zero in the UK by 2050. 

These will be used as inputs in the UK BEIS Carbon Price Model (UK BCPM), and other models in development within the Department.

The contractor will need to produce: 

i. An agreed approach to obtain consistency with BEIS internal assumptions (such as on energy demand, energy supply, policy impact analysis and resulting emissions - see suggested methodology- Section 3 of this specifcation). 
ii. Business As Usual (BAU) emissions and Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) for the UK ETS: as consistent with the scenarios set out in the sections below for central, high and low scenarios. These are: 
a. UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the years 2015 - 2050, to be disaggregated by sectors and technology within the traded sector and non-traded sector. We will be willing to consider various granularity of by time (e.g. yearly vs 5 yearly) given the prioritisation of other variable and the time available.
b. Corresponding Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) for the period. 
iii. an accompanying technical report.  

 To set out the reasoning for their approach, the contractor will also be required to provide:â¯ 

i. an explanation of their proposals for consistency with BEIS internal assumptions,â¯ 
ii. the assumptions and methodology theyâ¯propose toâ¯use in detail with reasoning,  
iii. a description of the quality assurance process and checks they will undertake and

One of the most important categories of organic food is fruit and vegetables which are characterized by high quality features in terms of sensory properties and nutritional content compared to conventional products, but these products are also high perishable. To this respect food processing technologies can contribute to extend the shelf-life of organic foods able to reduce food waste, improve sensory properties, and maintain higher nutritional content. However, traditional food processing techniques are used to process organic foods can have negative effects on the qualities of such products that can reduce consumers acceptance as well as have larger environmental impact. However, EU regulations do not specify and indicate which food processing technologies can be used to process organic food. Thus, there is a lack of understanding on which food processing technologies can be used and a lack of knowledge of processing technologies that are able improve the sensory and nutritional qualities of organic food and to reduce the environmental impact of processing technologies. 
Thus, there is a need of conducting research in developing new organic food processing technologies able to provide more sustainable production able to meet the consumer needs in terms of quality characteristics and reduced environmental impact. This project aims to improve the competitiveness of the organic sector in Europe by increasing the level of quality, sustainability, and consumer confidence of organic processed food products by testing new mild organic food processing technologies. This research can be beneficial to meet consumer expectations and needs in terms of organic food (i.e. better health, higher nutrients, reduce environmental impact), for organic food businesses to expand and diversify businesses opportunities, for policy makers to develop policies able to support the sector and, for the society as a whole to reduce the environmental impact, and create new job opportunities.",,,"Any region","73000000 ","XX XX",procurement@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,www.defra.bravosolution.co.uk,"Conditions of Contract - NP - Research and Development - MILDSUSFRUIT_final_Redacted.pdf ",,"This contract has been awarded by Defra to the UK Partner who successfully competitively tendered for an EU Let ERA-NET project.",01/04/2022,31/03/2024,27/03/2020,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,07/09/2022,97464,"[University of Reading|New Agriculture Building, Early Gate, Whiteknights Road PO Box 237, Reading|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,01/04/2022,31/03/2024,"Other ERA-NET SUSFOOD2",,12:00

The roadmap will list the specific countermeasures that, over defined timeframes, can ensure National Highways achieves its longer term Zero Harm target; in other words it will act as a 'what' to the 'why' represented by the vision of Zero Harm. The action plan will define the detailed actions that need to be taken by National Highways in order to enable the countermeasures to be implemented; in other words, it will be the 'how'.
The success of this roadmap and the action plan relies on achieving the buy in, and active participation from the full range of external organisations responsible for safety critical aspects of the road system  
These organisations have important stakes in road safety, nationally, and on the SRN and the development processes and evolution of the roadmap needs to be auditable and defendable.

ORR/CT/22/16,Contract,"OFFICE OF RAIL AND ROAD",Awarded,2022-09-07T11:22:41+01:00,"Assessing the impact of National Highways' Smart Motorways educational campaigns","ORR independently monitors National Highways' management of the Strategic Road Network (SRN) - motorways and main A roads in England. We hold National Highways to account for: 
â¢	how it plans and delivers its Road Investment Strategy (RIS); 
â¢	its performance, including efficiency, safety and sustainability, for the benefit of road users and the public; and
â¢	compliance with its licence.  
This is set out as part of our statutory role and requirements under the Infrastructure Act 2015. However, over the last two years, due to increasing concerns from a range of stakeholders over the safety of Smart Motorways, ORR has been called on to provide independent assurance and monitor specific areas of National Highways' delivery in relation to the safety of Smart Motorways. This includes holding National Highways' to account for delivery of the milestones and actions within DfT's Smart Motorway Safety Evidence Stocktake and Action Plan 

Alongside this, following increasing concerns over the safety of Smart Motorways, the Transport Select Committee (TSC) launched an inquiry into the rollout and safety of Smart Motorways. In November 2021, the TSC published its findings report which included nine recommendations for Government.
The Department for Transport (DfT) has responded to the TSC's report and agreed to take forward all nine recommendations. 
Within this report, there were three recommendations that specifically referenced ORR. These were:

ï	Recommendation 1: The Department should make the introduction of changes to the design and operation of the Strategic Road Network depend on a formal health and safety assessment by the Office of Rail and Road

ï	Recommendation 4: The Department and National Highways should commission the Office of Rail and Road to conduct an independent evaluation of the effectiveness and operation of stopped vehicle detection technology, including maintenance and monitoring.

ï	Recommendation 6: Beginning in September 2022, the Office of Rail and Road should be tasked with evaluating how successful the action plan has been in;
a) reducing incidences of live lane breakdowns on all-lane running motorways; 
b) reducing the time for which people who breakdown or stop in a live lane are at risk; and 
c) educating drivers on what to do if they breakdown in a live lane

ORR is seeking independent resources and expertise to support delivery of recommendation 6, part c), and assess the impact of National Highways' Smart Motorways education campaigns.

Objectives
ORR is seeking:
1)	validation of National Highways current evaluation framework, including the existing processes and governance in place to evaluate its education campaigns that can be applicable to smart motorways; and 
2)	a proposed methodology for assessing the on-road behavioural impact of National Highways' education campaigns that can be applied to smart motorways",,,"United Kingdom","79400000 ","Harriet Dinkele",procurementteam@orr.gov.uk,"25 Cabot Square",,London,E144QA,England,02072823944,,"Bravosolution Joining Instruction for open tender.doc ORR CT 22-16 Disclaimer.doc ORR CT 22-16 Form of Agreement - Professional Services.docx ORR CT 22-16 Form of Tender.doc ORR CT 22-16 ITT  for NH Campaign Assessment.docx ",,"This tender exercise is being conducted via our procurement portal Bravo.

The majority of the ground floor area is raised approx. 900mm above finished wharf level, with a series of loading dock doors to the perimeter. The building has several sets of access steps around the perimeter, some concrete some galvanised steel and some makeshift. This building is currently used for various functions including joinery, engineering, furniture reclamation and artist studios. Total floor area of approx. 1758 m2.

The works will be phased to allow continued use of the building. The building currently contains several individual workshop units - these units are self-contained within the main warehouse structure.  The building itself is located on a busy working wharf which will require careful consideration in the planning and undertaking of the works. The building and 'workshops' within will be occupied during the works.

KML wishes to appoint a contractor to carry out the re-roofing work package on a supply & fit basis. Whilst there is a specification for these works, we welcome any suggestions with regards to more efficient solutions.

NHS/SOEPS/19.487,Contract,"NHS SOUTH OF ENGLAND PROCUREMENT SERVICES",Awarded,2022-08-25T14:20:43+01:00,"MEMORY ASSESSMENT SERVICE","This VEAT notice is to inform the market that Sussex NHS intends to directly award a 12-month contract following a ten-day standstill period from the publication of this notice to Care Unbound Ltd (trading as HERE) for the provision of Brighton and Hove's Memory Assessment Service for NHS Sussex ('the Integrated Care System') commencing 1st April 2023.
National strategy dictates that health care systems ensure that people living with dementia are supported to live at home with their families for as long as possible. Early diagnosis and intervention, advance care planning, timely access to specialist assessment and treatment, and effective support for carers are key components of good care. Memory Assessment Services are the cornerstone to ensuring that people receive a timely diagnosis and that people living with dementia and those that care for them are supported throughout their dementia journey.

The service provides assessment, diagnosis, medication initiation and titration, and post diagnostic support for up to one year.
NHS Sussex intends to directly award to ensure key organisational change and transformation objectives, including the development of equitable Sussex wide approaches to service delivery are delivered. This will include the development of convergent standards and performance metrics, benchmarking of investment based on population needs, evident Health Inequalities and will be informed by population health clinical intelligence.
