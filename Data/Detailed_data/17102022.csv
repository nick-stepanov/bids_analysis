This will increase efficiency and capacity for condition assessments to be made partially or entirely remotely, allowing more sites to be monitored in less time and management resources distributed effectively based on current information. 

Considering all habitats, this project will investigate approaches that would be available to Natural England in the short to medium term (max 5 years) to gather, store and synthesise existing and new spatial/DNA/acoustic data to locate and monitor NEF indicators present on SSSI. 

Contractors should work through each of the indicators and describe how current monitoring technologies such as earth observation and / or 3rd party data could be used to detect and map NEF indicators and their impact on natural processes e.g. aquatic system modification, plus horizon scan for future tech. This is a pilot study with the aim to provide a summary of what techniques are available now and will be available in the next 5 years. We do not expect contractors to trial any approaches.

Aims and Objectives of the Project

The Hard-to-Treat (HTT) homes research aims to create a definition of and understanding of the scope of HTT homes in the UK, to support the development of policies that will effectively enable retrofitting and decarbonisation of these homes.
The objectives are as follows:
•	Identify the technical (including physical, material and technological), regulatory and social challenges to improving the energy performance and decarbonising HTT homes, taking account of spatial variability across the UK; 
•	Document and review the evidence on existing approaches to retrofitting HTT homes - including reviewing international policies, considering the costs to implement retrofit upgrades and implications for future retrofit schemes;
•	Develop a framework/definition, which identifies a spectrum of technical, physical and material attributes that make a home HTT from a whole house retrofit perspective;
•	Identify potential data and/or sources of information that could be used to identify HTT homes for both energy efficiency and low carbon heating;
•	Review, compare and propose best-practice methods and approaches (e.g. data analytics) for identifying HTT homes.",,"SW1H 0ET",,"73200000 79300000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House","North Star Avenue",SWINDON,"SN2 1FF",England,"01793 867000",www.uksbs.co.uk,"PS22165 - DPS Schedule 6 Order Form (SIGNED)_redacted.pdf ",,,02/11/2022,26/05/2023,19/08/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,158875,,12/10/2022,158875,"[DG CITIES LIMITED|Bank Chambers,1 Central Avenue

tender_336732/1168463,Contract,"Defra Network eTendering Portal",Awarded,2023-01-18T10:49:43Z,"MMO1329_2 - Traceability in the UK Seafood chain","Improving traceability, the extent to which fish can be verifiably tracked as it moves through the supply chain, is a key priority for Defra's Control & Enforcement policy team and the Marine Management Organisation. In the UK it is a legal requirement that all lots of fisheries and aquaculture products shall be traceable at all stages of production, processing and distribution, from catching or harvesting to retail stage. In practice demonstration of compliance is highly variable. 

The key challenges to improving traceability of fish are: 
- Accurately linking the physical fish with the data which is reported by fishers 
- Ensuring that data is submitted on time, accurately and in the correct format 
- Maintaining the accuracy of data as fish moves between stages (including the possible mixing of fish from different vessels). 
Beyond the domestic arena, traceability is critical in ensuring that consignments of fish can be successfully exported abroad for processing, transport and ultimate sale. Often time is critical in these scenarios, as fresh seafood has a short shelf life. There are clear synergies between the work investigating potential technologies and innovations which could facilitate greater traceability accuracy and timeliness to fulfil domestic legislative goals and wider Government priorities to facilitate fish exports and trade. 
The UK's ability to reliably demonstrate compliance with international IUU regulations through catch certification validation etc. is also a fundamental part of demonstrating its status as a capable, compliant independent coastal state within the global system. 
The project proposed here intends to make progress on looking for solutions to challenges 1 and 3 above - the data-fish link and how it is tracked through the supply chain.

      At present, most repositories charge on the basis of the number of storage units being delivered. That includes boxes of documents, sheets of drawings and boxes of material archive (finds). A recent survey of charging policies (Vincent 2017) shows that there is a good deal of variability in how much is charged per unit however, from around £20 to £300, while some museums still do not charge at all.
      Plans are now being made for a national archaeological archive store and resource centre, which will have to sustain itself on income from archive transfers and it is therefore important that a robust costing model is put in place.
      This project will investigate alternatives to charging for individual archive units (for instance charging a percentage of the overall project cost) and also determine the optimum charge that should be made for an individual archive unit, were that model to be adopted.  
      The main product will be a report that summarises the range of possible charging models, describes their strengths and weaknesses and makes recommendations accordingly.",,"SN2 2EH","Any region","73000000 ","Sheena Charrett",Sheena.Charrett@HistoricEngland.org.uk,"Firefly Avenue",Swindon,Wiltshire,"SN2 2EH","United Kingdom",07818422119,,,,,13/10/2022,13/10/2023,29/09/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,20000,25000,11/10/2022,27304,"[Sam Paul Heritage|141 Leach Green Lane, Rednal, Birmingham, United Kingdom, B45 8EL|NONE||No|No]",,13/10/2022,13/10/2023,"Open ",,12:00

After a high-profile national campaign, the winners will be decided by public vote, giving National Lottery players and the public a say in how National Lottery money is spent.

In May 2023, 15 projects across Scotland will be put forward for a public vote. Public voting on the programme means that projects are required to get support for their project from campaigning, including being featured in media with our media partners; ITV, UTV and The Sunday Mail in Scotland and Camelot; as well as campaigning on their own channels, such as social media, in person events etc.

We are therefore looking to procure a service provider to produce 15 videos - one for each project in Scotland. Previous examples of videos for projects taking part in The People's Projects can be found here: https://www.itv.com/news/central/2019-04-01/the-peoples-projects-has-launched-in-the-east-midlands.

This will be an 4 month contract until 23rd May 2023, with the option to extend by a further month. The maximum budget for this procurement is £90,000 including expenses (excluding VAT).

This contract will be subject to the Fund's standard terms and conditions. These can be accessed via the following link: https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/about/customer-service/supplier-zone/terms-and-conditions (this contract will be subject to our terms and conditions for over £10,000).

This is a Defined Term Agreement (DTA) for multiple, as yet unspecified, research projects relating to EU Borders Research.
The contract is for an agency to supply research services as required that are quantitative and qualitative in their approach and cost in the region of £60,000 to £200,000 for each project, although they can be more or less. The contract will be set up for two years initially, with a total maximum contract value of £2million across the two years, (an average spend of £1million per year) although the maximum is not a guaranteed spend.
Projects called-off the contract may be funded through the EU Exit Research budget (approximately £1 million per year) plus potentially some additional funding from the budgets of specific business areas where this is agreed with stakeholders/appropriate.

There will be an option to extend the contract by one year, up to a maximum of three years in total and not increasing the maximum contract value by more than 50% of the original contract value.

The research that will be commissioned through the DTA is integral to providing evidence to underpin policy decisions, changes and future planning for EU Borders related issues. The timings on projects can be incredibly tight, therefore going to market without a DTA in place can be tricky. The DTA would ease the commissioning of both the fast-turnaround and more BAU projects, whilst ensuring a high standard of work and that a fair commercial process was followed too.",,,"United Kingdom","73300000 ","Fintan Bradley",fintan.bradley@hmrc.gov.uk,"Trinity Bridge House, 2 Dearmans Place",,Salford,"M3 5BS",England,,,"EU Borders DTA Zip Contract - Redacted.zip ",,,18/10/2022,17/10/2024,17/10/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Products,2000000,,17/10/2022,2000000,"[Ipsos (Market Research) Ltd|3 Thomas More Square, London, E1W 1YW|COMPANIES_HOUSE|00948470|No|No]",,18/10/2022,17/10/2024,"CallOffFromDynamicPurchasingSystem ",,17:00

Overview
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is commissioning an evaluation of the recently announced Coastal Transition Accelerator Programme (CTAP) which is the final element of the £200 million Flood and Coast Resilience Innovation Programme (FCRIP). The £36 million for CTAP will be used to help deliver innovative practical actions to test new ways of helping communities adapt to the challenges of coastal erosion. The programme will start with the areas North Norfolk and East Riding of Yorkshire. This evaluation will undertake a Process, Impact, and Economic evaluation to produce evidence on the effectiveness and impact of innovative actions across selected coastal areas and gain a better understanding of the cost-benefits of actions to improve resilience to flood and coastal erosion risk. The evaluation will consider which actions work, for whom, and in what circumstance to inform how other areas can adopt similar principles or techniques in their coastal erosion risk planning.",,"SW1P 3JR","Any region","45246400 ","Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)",DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"Nobel House, 17 Smith Square,",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,,,"https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,27/10/2022,27/03/2027,20/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,315815,0,11/10/2022,315815,"[Risk & Policy Analysts Limited|Suite C, 2nd Floor, The Atrium, St Georges Street, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom, NR3 1AB|COMPANIES_HOUSE|2484467|No|No]",,27/10/2022,27/03/2027,"OpenNonOJEU ",,11:59

This is predominantly a desk-based numerical model study, although future work may progress to trialling some NBS measures.

The outputs of this project are required to embed the Groundwater and NBS concept into the catchment approach and improve water resources (i.e. increased soil infiltration rates, groundwater recharge rates, aquifer storage and summer base-flows) across Chalk catchments. The aim of this work is to increase our understanding of how NBS can support and improve water resources across Chalk catchments and to provide groundwater that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change and droughts.

As the Government's Maritime 2050 explained, supporting and building a green and sustainable UK Maritime economy is too important to ignore. 

It is indisputable that the Maritime sector is fundamental to the UKs success as a trading nation. 95% of UK trade in goods are carried by sea. This includes 25% of the UKs energy supply and 48% of food supplies. 
	

The sector contributes c.£17bn to GVA, supports 220,000 jobs and is comparably larger than the rail and air transport sectors. The productivity of the sector is 30% higher than the UK average; based on the average productivity of maritime workers - GVA per job increased during 2010-2017, from £70,000 to £77,000, exceeding the national average in each year. 

As an island nation that was founded off the backs of seafarers, the fortunes of the UK have always been linked to the sea and nothing is more illustrative of a prosperous UK than a vibrant and growing Maritime economy.

Therefore, the programme will:

-	Identify and emphasise some of the major barriers and opportunities to achieving carbon reduction and climate resilience of historic buildings
-	Highlighting best practice and innovation in carbon reduction for historic buildings and protection from harm to the fabric and historic significance of such buildings in the Square Mile.
-	Promote the business opportunity of retrofitting historic buildings and provide examples of cost / benefit analysis in terms of carbon and financial payback over time and at scale
-	Identify opportunities and challenges posed to historic buildings from hotter drier summers, warmer wetter winters, more frequent extreme weather events and sea level rise
-	Engage a broad range of innovators from across the development supply chain
-	Provide insights and guidance on the carbon reduction and climate resilience of historic buildings based on real-world case studies

This Traffic Order Management system (System) will operate across the entire region but will encompass individual access for each of the seven (7) constituent local highway authorities (LHA), being Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton who will have individual control of the traffic orders within their boundaries.

One of the critical aspects of this project is establishing the existing restrictions, prohibitions, and regulatory markings in each of the LHA areas. It is envisaged that best way of achieving this will be from detailed Ground Truth Surveys (GTS) of the highway in each LHA area. These surveys will then form the basis for the review of the on street signing and lining compared to the existing Traffic Regulation Orders which may ultimately result in new consolidation orders being produced in some or all of the LHA areas.

As part of this process, ORR is reviewing the Schedule 8 regime. Schedule 8 is the industry performance regime, which incentivises Network Rail and train operators for fluctuations in train performance from pre-determined benchmarks, and in so doing provides financial protection to operators against unplanned disruption. ORR's work on Schedule 8 is part of the 'charges and incentives' pillar of PR23 and is being led by ORR's Rail Economics team.

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire is hoping to attract a nationally recognised provider to prevent Violence Against Women and Girls to deliver an educational programme across a minimum of 6 colleges (and potentially wider) in Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton and Warrington. 

It is anticipated the successful provider will be recognised leader in this field commensurate with the ambition of this programme which is to set the standard for national good practice in the delivery of age-appropriate educational inputs to young people (and potentially wider) to raise awareness of sexual violence and other forms of VAWG, providing learners with the confidence and competence to manage disclosures. It is anticipated the provider will have a proven track record of delivery in this business area. 

The timescales for the delivery of this programme are challenging as such it is anticipated that the successful provider and indeed applicants will already have aspects of this programme ready for delivery with reasonable adjustments or have the expertise available to quickly use that knowledge to develop the relevant aspects.  This needs to be ready for an October 2022 implementation.

This programme will involve several aspects for delivery, with certain packages being required for delivery by November 30th 2022. Two thirds of this programme must be completed by 31st March 2023 and the final third by September 30th 2023.  

The contract will have the facility to be extended up to 31st March 2026 to cover additional educational arenas, subject to funding availability.

This procurement is being conducted under the Light Touch Regime and while it is an advertised process, the timescales and stages are designed by the PCC to meet the requirements.

      Portsmouth City Council wish to commission a service that will continue work piloted in 2021/22 to create a network of Safe Spaces. Utilising branding created and owned by the Council 'We stand together' and associated tool kit which includes a checklist for venues, the service will be responsible for the identification, on-boarding, training, and co-ordination of Safe Space venues across the Local Authority Areas of Portsmouth City Council, Isle of Wight County Council, Gosport Borough Council, Fareham Borough Council, and Havant Borough Council. Consortium bids are invited. 
      
      The Council encourages bids from consortiums along with other service providers that will either be able to deliver the service in its entirety or with other organisations. 
      
      For local suppliers that cannot meet the whole requirements but would like to make their services known to potential bidders, please contact the Council via In-tend correspondence, summarising your contact details and brief description of your services. The Council will then make this information available via In-tend to potential bidders, to engage with you directly if your services are of interest to them.
      
      The contract is for one year, with a maximum value of ?181,170.
      
      It is the Council's preference to include for the possibility of extending the term by a further year to a maximum total term of 2 years. The extension is not guaranteed and is subject to receipt of future grant funding, the agreement and performance of both parties.
      
      There is no guarantee that further funding will become available or if so, what the level of further funding may be. The best estimate the Council can make is to assume that it is approximately of the same value therefore if an extension were taken up the approximate total value of the contract for the two-year maximum term would be ?350,000 - ?400,000. However, these estimates are not guarantees and are non-binding in terms of value that may be let via the contracts.
      
      The procurement timetable is shown below and, while the council does not intend to depart from it, it reserves the right to do so at any time.

For some, this absence is undoubtedly Covid related but the levels far exceed this and there is increasing evidence that the most disadvantaged pupils across the UK are disproportionately affected (EPI, 2021). Attending school is one of the most significant factors in the well-being of children and young people (DfE, 2018). Poor attendance impacts a child's future, not just through their educational achievement but also socially and developmentally (Swansea University, 2021).

While absenteeism can be seen as a short-term condition, prolonged absenteeism may be a predictor of lasting issues that persist into adulthood (King, Ollendick &Tonge, 1995), such as ""school dropout, delinquency and occupational and relationship problems"" (Kearney & Bensaheb, 2006), and economic deprivation and social, marital, occupational and psychiatric problems (Kearney & Graczyk, 2014).

Kent County Council are looking to procure a countywide service that delivers a school-based intervention programme for persistently absent pupils (with a 90% or less attendance).

These pupils could present with a variety of barriers to attendance, which may include low level anxiety linked to poor peer relationships/networks, low sense of belonging in the school environment, and challenging relationships with adults at school and the level of need would not require an intensive model of support.

Poor mental health has frequently been linked to poor school attendance, with anxiety described as a key risk factor. There are many aspects of the school setting that may cause anxiety, such as separation from parents/carers, social interaction with peers/school staff, and academic stress which may lead pupils to avoid school. Somatic symptoms such as headaches and tummy-aches are also common in children with anxiety and may further contribute to absence.",,,"South East","80200000 ","Sam Wright",sam.wright@kent.gov.uk,"County Hall",,Maidstone,"ME14 1XQ","United Kingdom",,http://www.kent.gov.uk,,,,17/10/2022,31/03/2023,30/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,32980,,16/10/2022,32980,"[Project Salus CIC|Greenacres Barn

In 2019 we updated our suicide prevention toolkit, which supports our strategy in three distinct areas - prevention, crisis intervention and support after suicide.
A large focus of the toolkit has been to respond to known locations where suicide attempts, and suspected suicides have taken place. However, we want to do more to think about the risk of suicide much earlier within the planning and design of the network.

Specialist Cognitive Neurology provision is a vital element for patients with a complex Dementia presentation and ensures that people presenting with complex symptoms receive an appropriate diagnosis and can access treatment and services appropriate to their needs. The contract forms an integral part of NHS Sussex (East) Memory Assessment Service (MAS) provision in the legacy H&R and EH&S CCG areas. The service provides specialist diagnostic assessment including MRI Scanning, Lumber Puncture and associated Neuropsychological and Electroencephalogram (EEG) testing.

NHS Sussex has directly awarded this 24 month contract to Cognitive Neurology LTD to ensure key organisational change and transformation objectives, including the development of equitable Sussex wide approaches to Dementia service delivery are delivered. The direct award acts to align existing MAS contractual arrangements.
This will provide the necessary additional time for NHS Sussex to complete and embed its necessary transformation work and to understand better and accurately specify future specifications for these services. This will then inform commissioning intentions which will be put to the market in 2024/25.

      NML delivers a box office service year-round to our customers, in-venue and online. We process between 150,000 and 350,000 transactions per year with the majority [c. 80%] being chargeable transactions for exhibition tickets, events tickets, and membership sales. Our box office also processes bookings for school visits and group experiences as well as accepts donations to support the work of the organisation. The box office generates income between £500,000 and £1m per year depending on the programme.
      
      It's vital that the Ticketing Solution Provider understands that we've made the business decision to introduce Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, and for this reason also recognises that the cost of changing from our current CRM solution would be prohibitive to our business. For this reason, it is vital that the Ticketing Solution offered to us can be fully integrated with our existing CRM infrastructure, and not override or attempt to replace any of the core functionality we have chosen to utilise. For example, Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM is the principal system for managing Patrons and Members. We also utilise Dynamics 365 Customer Voice (Surveys) and Dynamics 365 Marketing (Email Marketing, Events Management), and the Ticketing Solution must be able to work with these key tools. We're also looking to make further use of integrations where possible such as between Ticketing Solution and Point of Sale and Event Management System. The Ticketing Provider will be expected to collaborate with various teams at NML, our CRM Solution Provider and our Web Agency.
      
      The contract value for the potential contract term of 5 years (until 30 November 2025 with the option to extend for two 12 monthly periods) is estimated not to exceed £170,000 GBP excluding VAT.
      
      Please note that as volume of transactions are demand led, any values and volumes of transactions stated are approximate and variable over the contract term.  Accordingly, no guarantee can therefore be given regarding the volume, nor value, of business placed.

Subsequent to the Commissioner publishing the ITT and receiving bids, the NHS inflationary factors were amended twice, resulting in an overall net uplift of 4.1%.
This period has seen unexpectedly high levels of inflation, due to market circumstances which were not foreseen by either the Commissioner or the bidders involved in this tender. The Commissioner understands that due to these high inflation levels, it will no longer be possible for some or all of its bidders to provide the services at the price bid in response to the original ITT.
The Commissioner has considered this issue regionally and has taken the decision to adjust the financial envelope across all contracts in order to reflect both the net increase in 2022/23 NHS inflation announced following the publication of the ITT, and the anticipated net inflationary uplift for 2023/24. This will have the effect that the contract value for each of the contracts awarded will be multiplied by 1.041.
This decision has been taken in consideration of how and when the financial envelope for this procurement was calculated and the timing of the tender in relation to the unforeseen inflationary pressures. As such it is particular to this procurement only, and does not have any implications or set any precedent for any current or future NHSE procurements.
In order to ensure equality and fairness for all bidders in this process, the Commissioner re-ran its evaluation process of each bidder's financial and overall scores using the proposed assumption that 4.1% inflation would be added to the bid price (not mobilisation costs). This process confirmed that the outcome of the competitive procurement process remains unchanged, and the same bidders have been successful on the basis of the adjusted figures.
To ensure consistency and transparency throughout the procurement, the Commissioner will be informing all bidders of the decision that has been made to increase the financial envelope for these contracts, prior to the commencement of the 10-day standstill period.",01/04/2023,31/03/2031,01/07/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,,11/10/2022,284852857,"[Practice Plus Group|Hawker House
