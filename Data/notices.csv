The scope for additional modules and subsequent spend were included within the Invitation to Tender and Award Notices. 

The PPF procured a licence and associated services for an Economic Scenario Model (ESM) for use in assumption-generation for a range of medium and long-term modelling. The solution provides a real-world calibration of an appropriate timeframe, including outputs for a sufficiently broad range of asset classes given the investment strategy of the PPF and the pension schemes it protects. The outputs also facilitate the projection of the liabilities of the PPF and those of the pension schemes it protects.

The contract awarded is for an initial duration of 60 months, with options to extend for up to three further 12 month terms. If the extensions are all exercised the total contract duration will be 96 months. If all extensions are executed the total final value is estimated to be Â£1,115,410.02 + VAT.

The PPF is a continuously developing business within a changing market and it is envisaged that there will be a future requirement for further components, modules or packages within the economic scenario model solution, including bespoke developments within the system which are reserved for the PPF&apos;s use only. It is fully envisaged that these components and modules will be developed over the life of the contract not only to reflect changes in the market, but also the PPF&apos;s strategy, including, but not limited to, changes in approach to the amount of business retained or brought in-house, the nature and size of the PPF&apos;s assets and liabilities and the PPF&apos;s approach to risk and return. This may require additional components and modules not currently listed, or development of the services themselves or existing services provided to the PPF which support or are supported by these services. It is further envisaged that additional software, including licences, may need to be developed to enhance the services, to increase efficiency and streamline the services, to increase the availability of the services in line with changes in the market, anticipated changes to the PPF&apos;s strategy over the life of the contract and changes in the nature and size of the PPF&apos;s assets and liabilities or to develop other services that support or are supported by these services. These additional services, systems, software and licences may result in price revision of the original contract and/or may significantly increase the fees paid in relation to these services over the life of the contract. The PPF makes no guarantee as to the nature and extent of such additional services, systems, software or licences.

Brief Description of Requirement

We are seeking consultancy support due to the tight timeframe that we are working within to analyse and produce the updated NPSs and the Government Response. Therefore, one of the key aims of the project is to have responses to questions on each individual NPS document simultaneously sifted and triaged, with a government response template produced, as quickly as possible to enable the policy teams to analyse and draft the necessary documents. 

We anticipate that you will meet with appropriate policy leads for EN1, EN3 and EN5 of the NPS on a regular basis (likely to be once every one to two weeks) for the duration of the contract. Each of the three components and their appropriate leads must be allocated equal and sufficient time and resources throughout the contract.",,,"Any region","73000000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,"01793 867005",www.uksbs.co.uk,,,,03/10/2022,17/08/2023,14/09/2022,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,49960,,02/11/2022,74391,"[MCC Economics Ltd|128 City Road, London, EC1V 2NX|COMPANIES_HOUSE|10883299|Yes|No]",,03/10/2022,17/08/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,11:00

1. A briefing note providing a qualitative summary of the response activities, their phasing, and their relative importance. 
2. A draft report which identifies the most appropriate conceptualisation of the cost structure of that response, and the evidence base that supports this recommendation; discusses the key factors (controls) that influence the costs of these activities; and provides an empirical assessment of the range of costs associated with each response activity, including how they are influence by the factors (controls). 
3. A final report, and also provides brief recommendations on future research priorities.     

Regular update calls should be expected with the Centre, and the consultant should present their results, either in person or online, to a wider Centre group in at least [1] workshop.

February 2024 - The following variations have been made since award. 

Nature and extent of the modifications (with indication of possible earlier changes to the contract):
- Variation 1: change added a new agent permission level between SAM admin and LA admin.
- Variation 2: brought forward the commencement date and end date by 1 month.
- Variation 3: addition of the Commercial Web Portal. The costs for this portal was already included for within the original contract as an additional cost that could be requested at any point during the term of the contract.
- Variation 4: change to support the partition of Cumbria County Council into two separate unitary authorities.
- Variation 5: development and ongoing maintenance of a mobile app that integrates with the ITSO AMS-HOPS Service currently procured.

Need for additional works, services or supplies by the original contractor/concessionaire. (Description of the economic or technical reasons and the inconvenience or duplication of cost preventing a change of contractor):
- Variation 5: contracting with another service provider would cause significant duplication of costs. South West Smart Applications Ltd (TA SAM) already have a deep working knowledge of the developed solution. Preparing and procuring a new contract for the mobile app that integrates with ITSO Part 11 would result in significant delay and duplication of costs in the delivery of the transport services.

This will ensure the effective involvement of parents, carers and young people in the design and delivery of SEND services and provision, including the continued embedding of the voices of SEND stakeholders in national policy development, to support system-wide improvements. We would require the Strategic Participation programme to respond to the long-term impact of Covid-19 (coronavirus) in the delivery of its business objectives and adapt its delivery in light of emerging priorities and recommendations identified through the SEND Review.

Through empowering children and young people with SEND and their parents to make informed choices about the provision available to them and supporting them to influence SEND policy at an individual, local and national level, services and provision can be designed in a way that works for children and young people user-centered system that meets their needs at the right level, this will counter the perception that statutory Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans and specialist provision are the only means through which children and young people with SEND can be properly supported. This in turn will reduce pressure on local delivery systems and demand for higher cost provision procuring a contract to continue existing participation and coproduction arrangements, consolidated with existing arrangements for a national helpline and online support service to provide information and advice to parents whose children have SEND.
This would provide the necessary government intervention to consolidate and grow meaningful participation and coproduction by families at an individual, local and national level.

The Service will support the recruitment to key governor roles of a diverse range of candidates who have skills, knowledge and experience appropriate to those roles.

To ensure that the service is targeted on those college governing boards which have the greatest need of help, referrals will be made via the Department. Priority will be given to colleges identified by Department colleagues. However, colleges will also be able to apply to the Department for consideration, for example, where they have experienced considerable difficulty in filling to the role of chair or committee chair, or in covering a particularly significant skills gap on the board.

The Department will assess and prioritise referrals to fit the targets and workflows set out in the contract with the Supplier. In making referrals to the Service, the Department will prioritise cases and roles where a quality appointment is judged to be key to strengthening governance in any given College. This could include but would not be limited to chairs, deputy chairs, and committee chairs for finance and audit.

Suppliers will be expected to have capacity and capability to deliver a quality service to college governing boards, taking into account the challenges of FE governor recruitment, and the demands and responsibilities of being an FE governor. Suppliers must also have due regard to the DfE FE Governance Guide and to the relevant governance codes.

The Supplier shall deliver a minimum of 137 well-matched, diverse and lasting appointments to governor roles during the Contract Period (subject to sufficient referrals). Recruitment should be spread across the three financial years. This might, for example, mean a target of 37 appointments in 2022-23, followed by 50 in each of the years 2023-24 and 2024-25.",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and The Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West","79600000 ",,emma.bagley@education.gov.uk,"Department for Education",,Darlington,"DL1 5QE",England,,,"FE Governor Recruitment - Contract and Schedules - REDACTED 2023.pdf ",,,01/09/2022,31/03/2025,06/06/2022,YES,tender_298633/1066903,Yes,No,No,Services,458333,,02/08/2022,458333,"[Peridot Partners Ltd|The Stanley Building, 7 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG|COMPANIES_HOUSE|06869005|Yes|No]",,01/09/2022,31/03/2025,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00

PS/21/114,Contract,"DRIVER & VEHICLE LICENSING AGENCY",Awarded,2022-01-26T11:22:20Z,"Provision of Building Surveying and Mechanical & Electrical Advice","2.1	The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (""DVLA"" or the ""Authority"") is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport, based at 3 sites in the Swansea region, employing around 6,500 staff. The Agency's primary aims are to facilitate road safety and general law enforcement by maintaining accurate registers of drivers and vehicle keepers, and to collect Vehicle Excise Duty. 

2.2	In March 2005 DVLA entered a 20-year PFI contract with Telereal Trillium (TT) for the refurbishment of the estate and the provision of facilities management (""FM""). DVLA and TT have agreed that DVLA has the option to de-scope the Soft Services element from the contract from 31st March 2023 (""partial Termination"").  The contract expires on 31st March 2025.  

2.3	A Facilities Management (FM) Futures programme was formed in 2019 within which the PFI Contract Expiry Team has the remit to deliver an effective contract expiry and transition from the current PFI contract.  The team comprises DVLA Estates Management, Commercial and 'project' personnel.  A business case was approved by the DVLA Executive team in January 2021 that supported procurement of technical advice to the programme.

2.4	The PFI contract expiry requires that all assets are returned to DVLA in good condition.  The expiry also means that it will be necessary to transition to a different operating model for the delivery of all FM services.  It is with both of these challenges that DVLA requires 'project' leadership and specialist technical advice to 

i.	Confirm the scope of assets to be returned and the efficacy of the asset register. 
ii.	Work with the results of a recent comprehensive asset condition survey.
iii.	Manage a 'survey on expiry' with commercial advisers in ensuring that the assets are returned in the requisite condition; and
iv.	To support the design of a new FM service delivery model and its implementation.

2.5	It is anticipated that project leadership/technical advice will be required in relation to projects related to the key asset types: - 

i.	Land & Buildings - Chartered Building Surveyor or applicable 
ii.	Plant & Equipment - Chartered Mechanical or Electrical Engineer or applicable

The Real-Time Indicators team works to develop and publish experimental indicators which measure and reflect changes in the UK economy and society. The team provide a timely picture of a range of activities that supplement official economic statistics and aid economic and monetary policymakers and analysts in interpreting the economic situation, and this is done using rapid response surveys, novel data sources and experimental methods. 

Footfall can be used to understand changes in consumer behaviour, and changes in it are associated with changes in retail and economic activity. As an indicator it can be used by policymakers to understand consumer confidence and highstreet performance. 

The Contracting Authority has previously received national footfall figures. This data showed overall UK retail footfall, as well as footfall by high street, retail park, and shopping centre category. Data could be used for illustrative purposes in the statistical bulletin, with underlying data not available to users. For this requirement the Contracting Authority are looking to build upon this and receive more granular data, and further category breakdowns. 

This data forms part of our week real-time indicator statistical bulletin, as an indicator of consumer behaviour, showing changes in the volume of visits to location types and regions.

The following variations have been made since award;

Nature and extent of the modifications (with indication of possible earlier changes to the contract):
- Variation 1: Compliance and audit review to understand the current landscape in terms of: - 
â¢	Roles, data access and the associated licensing implications 
â¢	Security and Auditing
- Variation 2: extension to the service transition, providing additional support services due to deficiencies in the completion of deliverables by an incumbent service provider.
- Variation 3: urgent requirement for interim support across Fusion Phase 1 implementation scope, namely HR, Payroll and Recruitment. This is as a result of their implementation partner unexpectedly withdrawing from an agreed change request and not completing an effective service transition to Fujitsu. In addition, the implementation partner has also now withdrawn support for effective service transition for Fusion Phase 2 scope, namely Finance, Purchasing, Projects and EPM.
- Variation 4: provision of solution architects and functional consultants to resolve and advise on identified defect change requirements, and to deliver solutions to priority changes within the scope of the available resource. It also includes additional resource to required to meet the larger than expected volume incidents.

Need for additional works, services or supplies by the original contractor/concessionaire. (Description of the economic or technical reasons and the inconvenience or duplication of cost preventing a change of contractor):
Contracting with another service provider would cause significant duplication of costs. Fujitsu Services Limited already have a working knowledge of the developed system and are contracted to accept handover of, and provide support to, the system. Preparing and procuring a new contract with a separate contractor for short term service provision would result in significant delay and duplication of costs in the handover to Fujitsu Services Limited.

Updated total contract value before the modifications (taking into account possible earlier contract modifications, price adaptions and average inflation):
- Original award total: Â£750,000 excluding VAT
- Variation 1: Â£53,910 excluding VAT
- Variation 2: Â£25,436 excluding VAT
- Variation 3: Â£341,997 excluding VAT

A  single  tender  action  is  requested  for  the following key reasons:

â¢N2O Sensitivity: The instrument must be able to resolve N2O at the parts per  trillion  level.  This  requires  that  the  instrument  operates  in  the  mid infrared (Mid IR) spectral range. MID IR based instruments such as the Aeris MIRA ULTRA have orders of magnitude greater sensitivity for N2O than  alternative  technologies utilised  by  all  competing  manufacturers.

â¢Field  portability:  The  analyser  must  be  weather  resistant,  capable  of operating  in  humid  environments  (>90%  humidity)  and  weigh  no  more than 6 kg as analyzers will be routinely carried to and operated around remote  field  sites. 

â¢12  hr+  run  time:  No  alternative  analyser  can  satisfy  the  low  power requirement  and  thus  long  run  time  required.  The  Aeris  MIRA  Ultra  has  the  added  advantage  that  any  portable external battery can be used to power the instrument allowing for long run times (up to 24 hours using commercially available portable battery banks) without the need for additional, expensive proprietary batteries.

The project is about setting-up and re-procurement of an E-Procurement and Contract Management system for use in KCC.

KCC is responsible for providing more than 300 public services such as education, transport, strategic planning, social services, public safety, and waste disposal. The organisation spends a sizeable amount of its budget purchasing various of good and services to meet its responsibilities. To meet these responsibilities, it is key to a have a reliable, useful eProcurement system that allows KCC to procure goods, services and works by following a uniform, systematic, efficient and cost-effective procedure in accordance with all relevant rules and regulations. 

The principle in public buying is to carry out procurements to a specified quality at the most competitive price in a fair and transparent way, which is embedded in UK Law when spending public money. The eProcurement system must adhere to these principles without fail and ensure the users of system - both buyers and suppliers - are aligned in this. This is aligned with KCC's strategic vision that aims at ""improving lives by ensuring that every pound spent in Kent is delivering better outcomes for Kent's residents, communities, and businesses.""

The Listening Exercise is a working title for the public facing process the Inquiry will use to gather people's experiences of the pandemic, providing a unique source of data for the Inquiry's legal team.  This Listening Exercise will be of sufficient scope and scale to capture people's experiences, give them a chance to be heard, and turn the experiences into an evidence base that can support the broad remit of the Inquiry's investigations.  This Listening Exercise will be run as a mixed programme, covering four pillars:
1) Research and Analysis 
2) Communications and Engagement 
3) Website (work already underway)
4) Emotional support/safeguarding 
The Inquiry requires specialist communication expertise to deliver the Communication and Engagement pillar of the Listening Exercise.  The Listening Exercise will provide a unique, comprehensive empirical account (via a set of synthesised, depersonalised reports) of the UK population's experience of the pandemic.  Accordingly, it is important that the Listening Exercise is as inclusive as possible, in line with the large number of people affected by the pandemic, and that the experiences we gather are representative of the UK population.  At the same time, it must be proportional in the delivery to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and to the Inquiry.  It will also demonstrate to the country that we are 'listening' to what the country wants to tell us, helping to maintain trust and confidence in the Inquiry and its findings.  Due to the nature of the subject material and the grief, trauma and health impacts experienced by many people, carefully designed communications and interactions are required, in line with the Inquiry's safeguarding responsibilities.

The government is committed to improving the delivery of public infrastructure and construction projects, including through more efficient processes and use of materials, greater adoption of technology and innovation, and the development of more effective delivery models with the supply chain. We must also ensure the significant investment in infrastructure and construction is supporting wider policy priorities, such as net zero by 2050 and levelling up. This has been expressed through the National Infrastructure Strategy, Construction Playbook and Transforming Infrastructure Performance: Roadmap to 2030.
The IPA uses its position at the centre of government to drive systemic change and provide expert advice to Ministers on infrastructure and construction policy and delivery. A robust understanding of current project performance is a key enabler for effective policy making and to monitor change over time.

In addition, insight suggests that some micro-businesses choose to trade as a limited company without fully understanding what this involves. This has consequences for corporate and personal compliance and can create unforeseen administrative burdens for the customer.

transformation workflow for judgments, built in an AWS infrastructure, taking transferred court judgments and upper tribunal decisions from TDR, transforming them to create xml for publication and delivering them to the Find Case Law service.
The next phase of work will make improvements to this initial pipeline and add a further transformation workflow to deliver records, including official-sensitive data, transferred from TDR to DRI in a format suitable for ingest into our preservation system. Our preference is the use of open-source systems. This second pipeline will build on the existing judgments pipeline but look to separate processes to create a decoupled approach. This second pipeline will be evaluated against a different approach (run by TNA staff) to enable us to determine the best long-term technical approach for a scalable, supportable service that will enable us to add new transformation workflows quickly.

      At present, most repositories charge on the basis of the number of storage units being delivered. That includes boxes of documents, sheets of drawings and boxes of material archive (finds). A recent survey of charging policies (Vincent 2017) shows that there is a good deal of variability in how much is charged per unit however, from around Â£20 to Â£300, while some museums still do not charge at all.
      Plans are now being made for a national archaeological archive store and resource centre, which will have to sustain itself on income from archive transfers and it is therefore important that a robust costing model is put in place.
      This project will investigate alternatives to charging for individual archive units (for instance charging a percentage of the overall project cost) and also determine the optimum charge that should be made for an individual archive unit, were that model to be adopted.  
      The main product will be a report that summarises the range of possible charging models, describes their strengths and weaknesses and makes recommendations accordingly.",,"SN2 2EH","Any region","73000000 ","Sheena Charrett",Sheena.Charrett@HistoricEngland.org.uk,"Firefly Avenue",Swindon,Wiltshire,"SN2 2EH","United Kingdom",07818422119,,,,,13/10/2022,13/10/2023,29/09/2022,NO,,No,No,No,Services,20000,25000,11/10/2022,27304,"[Sam Paul Heritage|141 Leach Green Lane, Rednal, Birmingham, United Kingdom, B45 8EL|NONE||No|No]",,13/10/2022,13/10/2023,"Open ",,12:00

Whilst the plan is intended to cover all the roads of Kent, the focus, per force, in recent years has been on the regular disruptions to the road networks leading to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover. The plan in particular deals with the distribution of food and water supplies to those queues of vehicles.

Historically, locally procured food and water supplies were distributed direct from suppliers to those caught on to the road network. This work was carried out by a combination of teams comprised, variously, of colleagues from HM Coastguard and members of the Kent Voluntary Sector Emergency Group.

After the events of Christmas 2020 where prolonged delays resulted from the border being closed for two days, it was recognised that local response capabilities had been severely overstretched. It was agreed with the Department of Transport that that a new centrally funded procurement and distribution plan was required to respond to events that were triggered by ""national events"" and where they going to last for longer than 1-2 days.

Currently, under an interim plan, food and water, again procured locally as and when required, is brought to the National Highways depot at Stamford, just off Junction 11 of the M20. From this location supplies are distributed on to the road network using the same volunteer network.

The Government Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution2 outlines further commitments to low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear power. Renewable energy, nuclear power station developments, and other Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are all required to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), as well as other statutory assessments, to fulfil environmental regulations and support the consenting process for the projects.
There is currently a lack of guidance on the process to define the geographic scales of populations of fish species in the marine environment, as required for use in EIA, Habitats Regulations Assessments (HRA), and Marine Conservation Zone assessments (MCZa). Establishing standardised process will ensure consistency in approach between projects, robustness for consenting processes, and has the potential to de-risk and streamline the consenting process for developments and regulators.
EIA has traditionally taken an approach of assessing losses of fish in a solely anthropogenic context, comparing losses to fishery management stock units, or fishery landings data. This approach however, is not considered relevant when assessing fish populations as features of MPAs, Estuarine N2K sites (SAC/RAMSAR), or as prey species for protected marine mammals and seabirds. High-quality, standardised assessments will contribute to delivering the 25 Year Environment Plan and achieving Good Environmental Status under the UK Marine Strategy.",,"SW1P 3JR",London,"73100000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,,"https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,03/10/2022,24/03/2023,30/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,0,30/09/2022,48037.5,[||NONE_OTHER||No|No],,03/10/2022,24/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,12:00

The pipes were installed through directional drilling and emerge from under the sea bed at the discharge point. Each pipe comes to a T piece with duck bill diffuser elements fitted to each end of the T section. 

The base of the discharge arrangement was not sufficiently supported and this has allowed the pipework to rotate impacting discharge flows.

This needs to be repaired and returned to the correct position with improvements to the support of the diffusers from a pre cast concrete base. The diffusers also had a protective structure that has been dislodged and this needs to be replaced by a new protective sleeve and cap. The protective sleeve can either be a pre-cast concrete pipe or an HDPE pipe section which will be capped by a pre-cast concrete or GRP lid. 

The replacement duckbills will have to be fitted after the sleeve is placed. Alternatively, arch shaped cut-outs could be implemented, to fit over the duckbills. The ""duckbill"" check valves will protrude slightly through holes/ windows prepared for purpose and will discharge normally. 

Construction

Due to operational requirements shut down of the pipelines must be well planned and durations kept to a minimum. Based on our feasibility studies the shutdowns are estimated to be no longer than 3 hours per pipeline. All the rehabilitation operations that require no flow through the pipe must be programmed to take place at the same time so that only one shut-down period is required.
The following tasks will need to be completed under shutdown:
â¢	Disconnection of the flange adapter and replace. 
â¢	Align the diffuser to vertical and temporarily secure. 
â¢	Remove the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves. 
â¢	Drop the protection sleeve into position. 
â¢	Replacing the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves

Divers to conduct the following site preparation activities. 
â¢	Clearing loose rubble around the flange adapter and concrete base footprint. 
â¢	Rock drilling may be required to level concrete base footprint.

â¢	Replace/ rehabilitate and install: 
â¢	Blank flange o Sacrificial break away spool piece (optional) 
â¢	Flange Adapter - and right the diffuser to vertical alignment. 
â¢	Remove the diffuser Tideflex Check Valves. 
â¢	Place and secure precast concrete base 
â¢	Drop the protection sleeve into position.

CA18/2/1/42,Contract,"The Coal Authority",Awarded,2022-12-29T13:05:41Z,"Environmental Data Management","The Coal Authority generates large volumes of environmental data through the part of our business which manages the environmental legacy of mining across the UK. We operate over 75 mine water treatment schemes that remove contaminating metals from mine water prior to the treated water being discharged into a receiving watercourse. Schemes range from complex process engineering plants, through pumped wet wells and boreholes / mineshafts, to totally natural (passive) schemes without a power source.  The majority of treatment schemes comprise of aeration cascades, settlement ponds and reed beds. All schemes are subject to regulatory consents and licenses. 

We have an extensive monitoring network across the mine water treatment schemes monitoring scheme performance. A wider network of boreholes and sampling locations is used to monitor changes in ground water level (monitoring mine water recovery across coalfields) and water quality within mine workings and at untreated mine water discharges. The total number of monitoring locations is around 2,000 but this may rise to nearer 3,000 as new treatment schemes are built or treatment trials carried out. We are increasingly helping others with monitoring of other types of mines.

Environmental data is collected across the treatment schemes and monitoring network which includes; laboratory analysis of water and solids, onsite water quality measurements, hydrometry data including manual and logged stage and flow readings from weirs and spot flow gauging, telemetered process data (such as pump rates or electric metering), manual and logged water level and temperature measurements from boreholes or mine shafts, logged rainfall data, manual or logged gas data and solid samples of lagoon sludge. Most data types are collected as continually expanding time series. A small part of the overall data comprises geophysical surveys of boreholes and shafts.

The Coal Authority has a requirement for a single data storage system which will consolidate our environmental data sets, incorporate data processing, quality checking and editing tools (including recording of any automated, or manual data changes) and make the data more accessible for use across the business.  

We are inviting tenders for provision of an environmental data management system that will modernise the collection, quality checking, editing, storage, analysis and reporting of our environmental data.

In the UK it is a legal requirement that all lots of fisheries and aquaculture products be traceable at all stages of production, processing and distribution, from catching or harvesting to retail stage. In practice demonstration of compliance is highly variable. 

The key challenges to improving traceability of fish are: 
- Accurately linking the physical fish with the data which is reported by fishers 
- Ensuring that data is submitted on time, accurately and in the correct format 
- Maintaining the accuracy of data as fish moves between stages (including the possible mixing of fish from different vessels). 

Beyond the domestic arena, traceability is critical in ensuring that consignments of fish can be successfully exported abroad for processing, transport and ultimate sale. Often time is critical in these scenarios, as fresh seafood has a short shelf life. There are clear synergies between the work investigating potential technologies and innovations which could facilitate greater traceability accuracy and timeliness to fulfil domestic legislative goals and wider Government priorities to facilitate fish exports and trade.",,"SW1P 3JR",London,"73100000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,,"https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,24/10/2022,24/04/2023,17/10/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,0,17/10/2022,49700,[||NONE_OTHER||No|No],,24/10/2022,24/04/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,12:00

MCAA sets out the responsibility of various stakeholders in relation to marine plan use. For example, under S58 of MCAA any decision made by a public authority (including the MMO) which could affect the marine area, either in whole or any part, must either be in accordance with, or have regard to, the appropriate marine policy documents, including marine plans, unless relevant considerations indicate otherwise. 
Developing and adopting technically sound marine plans and plan policies followed by successful use is crucial to delivering desired outcomes.

In the UK it is a legal requirement that all lots of fisheries and aquaculture products be traceable at all stages of production, processing and distribution, from catching or harvesting to retail stage. In practice demonstration of compliance is highly variable. 

The key challenges to improving traceability of fish are: 
- Accurately linking the physical fish with the data which is reported by fishers 
- Ensuring that data is submitted on time, accurately and in the correct format 
- Maintaining the accuracy of data as fish moves between stages (including the possible mixing of fish from different vessels). 

Beyond the domestic arena, traceability is critical in ensuring that consignments of fish can be successfully exported abroad for processing, transport and ultimate sale. Often time is critical in these scenarios, as fresh seafood has a short shelf life. There are clear synergies between the work investigating potential technologies and innovations which could facilitate greater traceability accuracy and timeliness to fulfil domestic legislative goals and wider Government priorities to facilitate fish exports and trade.",,"SW1P 3JR",London,"73100000 ",Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,"17 Nobel House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,00,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,,"https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ",,24/10/2022,31/03/2023,17/10/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0,0,17/10/2022,0,[||NONE_OTHER||No|No],,24/10/2022,31/03/2023,"OpenNonOJEU ",,12:00
